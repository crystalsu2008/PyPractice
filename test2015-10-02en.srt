00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,570
International Gathering
with Supreme Master Ching Hai

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,605
Europe, Jul- Oct 2015

3
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,589
Share, share together.

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,292
So the more we use water, the more…

5
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:27,927
Inside. No problem, we have room.

6
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,596
And this is very light.

7
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,997
We’re like family here.

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,532
Yes, Master.

9
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:33,933
My secret.

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,302
Hmm, looks so nice.

11
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,405
It's like a dream, Master.

12
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,206
It's like a dream? (Yes.)

13
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,474
OK. Don’t wake up.

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,413
We have guests in the house,
so we cook for everybody.

15
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,348
Food’s ready. Yum, yum!

16
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,054
Delicious.

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,223
He ate already lunch and,
he ate his lunch already,

18
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,759
He just likes to feel the love.

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,728
OK, just a snack. All right?

20
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,832
Cheers! Cheers!

21
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,966
Cheers!

22
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:14,708
One, two, three.

23
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,709
What is that?

24
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,043
I cut it anyway.

25
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,918
I love you.

26
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,823
Love you. (See you, Master.)

27
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,964
BUDDHIST STORIES:

"GREAT-WEALTH
THE TREASURER'S SON"

29
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,171
OCTOBER 2, 2015

30
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,540
Hallo!

31
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,047
Are you guys all right there?

32
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,282
I see you very clearly. You see me?

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,784
Yes, very clearly.

34
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,818
Of course you can see me

35
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:03,456
without any help, any machine,
nothing.

36
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,325
OK, wonderful.

37
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,228
I can see you just like
right in front of me.

38
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,063
Wow! How come it's so clear here?

39
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,231
Why didn't you tell me earlier,

40
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,001
so we don't have to
struggle down there? (Yes.)

41
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,838
OK, then. You have enough room?
Yes? Everybody?

42
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:19,839
We’re good now.

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,307
OK. You can sit down.

44
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,176
Don't have to hide there.

45
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,645
Sit here or here.

46
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,781
You need to sit there
because there's no room, right?

47
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,548
Yes, we're good.

48
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:32,318
Oh, you're OK.
The guys you can handle, right?

49
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,088
You can sit on the window.

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,328
What did you eat today?
(Rice.)

51
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,363
We had a party,

52
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:47,901
a veg-party so many delicious foods…

53
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,137
(Oh?) fruits and…

54
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,940
Pie? What kind of pie?

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,008
What kind of pie?

56
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,343
We had a bread.

57
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,044
Bread? (Yes.)

58
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:02,048
Oh, I thought you said pie.

59
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,717
So bread, right?

60
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,520
Yes. We enjoyed the food very much.

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,826
OK, rice and vegetable
and protein and all that, right? (Yes.)

62
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:15,061
OK. Lucky people.

63
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,496
Thank you, Master.

64
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,865
Over here, what did you eat today?

65
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,335
(Noodles.)
Noodles fried or noodle soup?

66
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,505
(Fried.) Fried.

67
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,574
I wish I could eat both from here.

68
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:29,542
This food here,

69
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,247
and food there.

70
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,818
My God!
Is it raining a lot over there?

71
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,255
Oh, terrible here. Same, the whole day.

72
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:47,627
The whole day yesterday,
almost the whole day yesterday,

73
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:52,399
and now it's still raining.
Is it raining there also? (Yes.)

74
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,870
Wow! It's rainy
and very windy.

75
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,808
Even today I cannot let the big dog
go outside,

76
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,977
except when he has to go down

77
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:08,114
to do his business
and to eat something.

78
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:14,020
Otherwise he just stays indoors
because it's so terrible.

79
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,189
But that's just the beginning yet.

80
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:21,995
Beginning only, we will have
more trouble later, more rain.

81
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:27,334
So are you going tomorrow,
some of you? (Yes.)

82
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,705
How many go tomorrow?
(Three of us.)

83
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:36,109
Raise hands.
Oh, most of you go tomorrow.

84
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,747
All right.
Have a good trip.

85
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,216
You have a good trip.

86
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,686
Your holiday is very short this time.

87
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,725
I was thinking

88
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:56,029
it's the rain that makes the Internet
and the connection kaput.

89
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,833
Oh my God. Can you hear me at all?
I feel like it's choppy.

90
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,701
It's OK, Master.

91
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,336
OK. Because it's raining,

92
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:07,307
maybe that's why we couldn't
have a connection very well.

93
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,745
I had to go upstairs in this room.
It's good.

94
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,416
It's OK now, right?

95
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,717
Later we'll know.

96
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,386
I know.

97
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:24,691
We are upstairs here
and it's not equipped like downstairs.

98
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:29,696
So they are patching the ceiling
with something and this and that,

99
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:34,668
and the camera might fall off
and oh my God!

100
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,003
Or maybe the light will fall off.

101
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,473
It looks very professional
with all the tape.

102
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:53,486
You guys should use duct tape,
duct tape.

103
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,488
We have it here. (You have it?)

104
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,489
It's maybe…

105
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,993
Oh no, I'm not sure either.
It's falling, falling.

106
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,231
Wow, the Supreme Master's house,

107
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,967
very professional.

108
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,703
You saw it? You saw that?

109
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,506
Can they see it there? No,  they cannot.
Never mind.

110
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:20,080
They are trying to tape
the light reflector, two men.

111
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,116
Two men are busy with that.

112
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,684
I wish you could see it.

113
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,520
Very professional, what we have here.

114
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,527
Poor men. My God!

115
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:40,433
All right. If this thing falls off
I think we call it a day.

116
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,673
Or maybe you can just stay there
and hold it.

117
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,009
Take turns to hold it.

118
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,212
It keeps falling off again.
All right. Never mind.

119
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,917
So you meditate inside the house, right?

120
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,856
Inside the room is very comfortable,
right? (Yes.) Yes, OK.

121
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,225
It's good that
you are sent there

122
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:10,497
because over here it’s raining so much
you'd probably be wet all day.

123
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:15,201
You wouldn't have enough chance
to change your clothes.

124
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,206
And wherever you sat before
to meditate outside is all wet.

125
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,809
Even though we have tape

126
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,814
and we do everything possible
but it's still all wet.

127
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,351
So that's why I sent you on time.

128
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:36,556
Are you thanking me or not?
No, you're not. (Yes.)

129
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,659
You wish you were here, right?

130
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,801
It's a bit wet and the staircase
is slippery and all that.

131
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,769
It's not fun. It's not fun.

132
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:55,575
It's truly very rainy here,
all day long since yesterday, non-stop.

133
00:07:55,575 --> 00:08:00,246
So it's good that you're there,
and warm and cozy.

134
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:07,187
And you have your bathroom
right inside your room. Convenient.

135
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:13,159
If you stay here,
it's impossible to take care of yourself.

136
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,699
Then we'd have to
buy everybody a raincoat,

137
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,435
and then we'd have to
buy everybody an umbrella.

138
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,572
And then, oh I don't know,
what else do we have to buy?

139
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,208
And boots! Rain boots.

140
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:33,847
Umbrella and rain coats and, oh man!

141
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,983
It's good that you are there.

142
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,219
If you have to leave tomorrow
or the next day,

143
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,456
have a good trip. (Yes.)

144
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,993
Everybody's there, right? (Yes.)

145
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,997
All the good, the bad
and the beautiful, are there.

146
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,405
My God! OK.

147
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,143
Now, I have this and we're perfect.

148
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:09,983
Now you can recognize your Master.
All right.

149
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:26,099
According to Buddhism
and the believers and the tradition,

150
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,902
when you read sutra and all that,

151
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,238
you have to put on incense, flowers,

152
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,841
and bow to the sutra first,

153
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,043
and thank all the Buddhas
and Bodhisattvas

154
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:42,349
in ten directions respectfully
before you read it.

155
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:46,720
And then you cover the sutra also
with (vegan) silk or beautiful cloth.

156
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,491
I just make it more popular,
more easy, simple.

157
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,226
I apologize to all the Buddhas.

158
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,029
I say,
"If I have done something wrong

159
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,064
according to the tradition,

160
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,200
my heart is full of respect.

161
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,836
It's just that I cannot always do that.

162
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,137
So please, all the sin,

163
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:07,307
whatever I have done wrong,
is all on me."

164
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,910
At least, other people,
when they hear the names of the Buddhas,

165
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,081
according to the sutra,
they will get benefit.

166
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,055
This story is called "Great-Wealth."

167
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:26,893
Great-Wealth is his name,
"The Treasurer's Son."

168
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:31,931
I hear this kind of noise, echo.
Do you hear very well there?

169
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,335
(Yes. Very well.)
Good, good. OK, then.

170
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:44,010
Having led neither the holy life
nor riches won while young.

171
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,113
This instruction was given
by the Buddha,

172
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:53,353
while he was in residence at Isipatana

173
00:10:53,353 --> 00:11:00,360
with reference to Great-Wealth,
Mahadhana, the treasurer's son.

174
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,962
I don't know who the treasurer is.

175
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:11,571
Great-Wealth is a name,
Mahadhana, that's great wealth.

176
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:19,245
Great wealth in Sanskrit
I think means Mahadhana.

177
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:23,883
Great-Wealth, it appears,
was reborn at Benares

178
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:30,190
in a household worth 80 crores,

179
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:36,329
meaning probably millions,
millions of dollars.

180
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,166
Now his mother and father
thought to themselves.

181
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,035
It's choppy?

182
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,704
Can you hear me very well there?
(Yes.)

183
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:50,010
Not choppy, not disturbed?
Oh, one? Yes, no?

184
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,380
It's choppy sometimes
and we don't see you well.

185
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,918
OK. Then use
your wisdom eye to see me.

186
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,988
I see you very well.

187
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:09,662
It is because we don't have
good Internet here.

188
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,700
Over there, the Internet is better.

189
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,270
That's why before
I rented a room in a good hotel

190
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,808
so that we have like fast Internet,
non-interrupted.

191
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,011
We blame it on "collective karma."

192
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,646
OK. Now.

193
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,951
His mother and father,

194
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:37,757
I guess they were a rich family.

195
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,627
His mother and father
thought to themselves,

196
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,464
"We have a vast store of wealth
in our house

197
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:49,002
and there is no necessity that
our son should do anything else

198
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:53,473
than just enjoy himself
according to his own good pleasure."

199
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:59,346
Accordingly they had him
instructed in singing

200
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:03,950
and in the playing
of musical instruments.

201
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,852
You still can see me,
the whole body,

202
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,620
the whole face, right? (Yes.)

203
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,521
OK. Good.

204
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:13,159
And if you hear me choppy,
then please just don't care.

205
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,894
What else to do?

206
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,596
And later when you come home

207
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:22,936
this will be uploaded on the Internet
with everything for you.

208
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:27,640
I'm trying my best already,
but this is the world.

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,277
We don't always have everything
we want.

210
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:36,383
When I bought this house
I didn't think of the Internet or anything.

211
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,518
And even though we have the Internet

212
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,521
but it's not fast and not very good.

213
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,624
Normally I don't use it.

214
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,195
So accordingly, they had him instructed.

215
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:57,103
It means they let him learn singing
and in the playing of music.

216
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,507
And that was all the instruction
he received.

217
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,810
Likewise, in that same city,

218
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,514
in a household worth
80 crores of treasure,

219
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:11,651
also another rich family,

220
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,753
a daughter was born.

221
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:18,858
The same thought occurred to
her mother and her father also.

222
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,963
And they had her instructed
only in dancing and singing.

223
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,532
What a match!

224
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,737
When the two reached the proper age,

225
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:34,641
they were married with
the customary ceremonies.

226
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,312
In the course of time,
both their parents died

227
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:45,552
and then there were twice 80 crores
of treasures in the same house.

228
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,390
It was the custom

229
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,229
of the treasurer's son
to go thrice a day to wait upon the king.

230
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:05,038
One day a company of knaves who
lived in the city, thought to themselves,

231
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:09,109
"If this treasurer's son would
only get drunk,

232
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,644
it would be a fine thing for us.

233
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:18,385
Let us show him how to get drunk."
Oh, man.

234
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:22,522
Accordingly,
they procured strong drink,

235
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:27,293
put roast meat, salt and sugar
in the skirts of their clothing,

236
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,330
and taking roots and bulbs,

237
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,299
seated themselves
in a convenient place,

238
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,537
watching the path by which

239
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:42,942
the treasurer's son would
approach from the royal palace.

240
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:48,782
When they saw him approaching,
they began to drink strong drink,

241
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,719
placed particles of salt and sugar
in their mouths

242
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:57,357
and took the roots and bulbs
in their teeth and chewed them.

243
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,628
And they said,

244
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:05,999
"Live for a hundred years,
Master Treasurer's son."

245
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:09,736
They wished him a long life.

246
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:16,276
"With your help may we be enabled
to eat and drink to our hearts' content."

247
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:22,282
Hearing these words, the youth asked
the little page who followed him,

248
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:26,486
"What are these men drinking?"

249
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,688
"A certain drink, Master."

250
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,124
"Does it taste good?"

251
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,727
"Master, in this world of the living,

252
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:37,864
there is no kind of drink
to be had comparable to this,"

253
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,935
meaning it's a very good drink.
What about?

254
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,338
Must be, maybe alcohol and cocktail,
something like that.

255
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,241
They were trying, these people were bad.

256
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:53,513
They were trying to seduce him
into drinking strong liquor and all that,

257
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,782
like ruining him.

258
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,351
This is the problem, you see.
You see that?

259
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,021
Originally, this boy was a good boy.

260
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,491
He didn't even know what drink was.

261
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:10,196
And they just sat there,
right where he was passing by,

262
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:15,535
so that he'd be exposed
to this kind of bad drink,

263
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:19,706
bad kind of lifestyle.
It is a problem.

264
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:28,048
Same in our world nowadays.

265
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:36,089
Many bad things were introduced
to our young, innocent people

266
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:43,563
and that's how they fell into the trap
of bad life and then they cannot get out.

267
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:47,400
Or they get out with injury,

268
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,372
to their mental or emotional,
or physical life.

269
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:55,475
This is to be pitied.

270
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:05,118
So the parents must always take care,
must watch over their children well

271
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:10,824
and don't let them be prey
to this kind of company.

272
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:14,894
There was a sister

273
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:19,099
who used to cook Aulacese
(Vietnamese) food for me.

274
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,235
Every time she came,
she didn't want to go home.

275
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:27,273
And she had one, about 20 years old,
two sons,

276
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,576
and one 15 years old.

277
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,078
I kept telling her to go home
but she said, "No, no,"

278
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:35,048
and then she always
made an excuse to extend it.

279
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:41,287
So I’d have to scold her somehow,
otherwise she would never go.

280
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,693
These people, these sons are
still young,

281
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,129
they need somebody
to watch over them all the time

282
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,165
and check every day
if something happens.

283
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:58,838
Otherwise, at home they see
only one father or one mother.

284
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,573
And now they don't even have the father

285
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,342
because they've divorced,

286
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,277
so only the mother's there.

287
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:08,014
And if they don't see them,
don't see the mother even,

288
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:14,921
then they easily fall prey
to the bad society outside.

289
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:24,631
The thing is, at home is only one
person, the mother, to take care of them,

290
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,167
to tell them what's good from bad.

291
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:34,574
But outside are
big society, schools, many peers,

292
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,444
outside are many bars,
many restaurants,

293
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:42,949
they're all full of meat, and alcohol,
and drugs and things like that.

294
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,852
So even one against many already,

295
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:52,826
and her sons, only one,
only, so one or two against many.

296
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:54,828
That is very difficult already.

297
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:59,065
And if she keeps staying here
nearby me, which she likes,

298
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,400
of course I understand that.

299
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,003
Everybody likes to stay
and I don't blame her.

300
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:09,542
it's just that if we already have
made the bed, we lie on it.

301
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,383
We have children,
we have to take responsibility,

302
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:25,692
because their future is groomed
from childhood on already.

303
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:30,764
Wait until they fall into trouble,
then it's too late to correct.

304
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,066
And one trouble will lead
to another trouble

305
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:40,140
and we will not be able
to forgive ourselves.

306
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,010
If we didn't want any trouble
or didn't want a lot of work,

307
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,613
children are work, of course.

308
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:49,716
But nobody knows that
until they have them.

309
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,550
This is the problem.

310
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,254
Nobody tells them that
children are a problem.

311
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,691
Even if they told them,

312
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,592
when they're young, they're in love

313
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,262
and honeymoon, honeycake, whatever.

314
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:06,499
At that time, nobody can tell them what.

315
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:15,475
All these romantic visions about
having a handsome husband

316
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:21,414
and romantic couple
and have a couple of children

317
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:25,251
like everybody else,
and take the children to go to school

318
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:29,356
and then later they become somebody.

319
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,492
They don't know; they don't know.

320
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,729
And then the children grow up,
it's not the way they wanted.

321
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,331
They have their own personality.

322
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:42,102
And when they are young teenagers,
they just hate you for no reason.

323
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:46,373
And if you're not there,
they will listen to their buddies,

324
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:52,012
who sweet talk them into drinking
and drugging and smoking

325
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:55,248
and do all kinds of stupid things.

326
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:57,650
Or they go out
and have a big party, drinking

327
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,554
because they have reached 18.

328
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,591
They go out drinking
and then if one is drinking

329
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,493
the other dares them to take drugs

330
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:11,798
and then everything else
is born from there as well,

331
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:21,675
including unwedded children,
teenage mothers, etc., etc.,

332
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:26,780
or sometimes injuries,
wounding or death.

333
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,682
Because when they are drunk,

334
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:32,519
many things happen
beyond their control.

335
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,320
They are still at a tender age.

336
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,991
Even at 18 or 20, they're still tender

337
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:41,428
and really need somebody
always there for them.

338
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:49,736
You see, this poor treasurer's son,
normally he was a good boy.

339
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,938
He was married already
and he was happy

340
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:54,607
and he never did anything wrong.

341
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:58,511
And then they sat right
in the middle of the road somewhere

342
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,282
ambushing him with good drink
and good food,

343
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:07,587
and sweet talk, seducing him.

344
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,956
And then of course the boy
didn't know anything and asked,

345
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:14,794
"What is it? Is it good?"
and of course they said, "It's good."

346
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:17,364
Of course it might taste good,

347
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:21,568
but is it good for your body,
your mind, your spirit, or not,

348
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,337
that is another thing.

349
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:33,213
One time, there was
one follower of the Buddha,

350
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:39,252
the legend has it that one time
one follower of the Buddha,

351
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:47,494
he took the Five Precepts,
like not harming others or killing others,

352
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:49,929
and not stealing, not telling lies,

353
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:56,036
not having illicit, I mean,
not improper sexual conduct,

354
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:59,472
and not drinking

355
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:04,044
and not taking intoxicants
like alcohol and drugs.

356
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:08,148
And then somebody,
I don't remember how it came to it

357
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:11,985
that he had to choose
to break one Precept.

358
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:15,321
So he thought, OK, he cannot kill,
he didn't want to kill.

359
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,323
He didn't want to have improper sex.

360
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,660
He didn't want to steal,
he didn't want to tell lies.

361
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:26,633
So he thought, OK, if he drinks alcohol,
then it's only harming himself.

362
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,971
He didn't even think it's harmful.

363
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,608
It looks good, drinking cool
and sitting and drinking

364
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:39,279
and then happy, happy, it looks like.

365
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,751
So he drank and then after that
he did, he broke all the Precepts.

366
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:53,126
Because alcohol somehow
brings the worst out of you.

367
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:59,733
Inside, all the bad qualities within you,
it makes them arise.

368
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:05,171
It will blind your reason,
numb your thinking

369
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,606
and then anything else you do

370
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:11,311
you don't even consider bad
or good, just anything.

371
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,984
That story was very bad,

372
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:24,057
but I don't want to really detail it here
because it's too bad.

373
00:25:24,057 --> 00:25:30,663
All right, so this is the thing
about having company.

374
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:34,934
That's why we say,
"Show me your friends,

375
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:39,439
show me whom you are with,
then I know all about you."

376
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:40,707
It's like that.

377
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:44,911
So friends, we have to
choose very wisely.

378
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,246
It's just children sometimes,

379
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,281
they don't know who is good,
who is bad.

380
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:52,352
Even we adults, sometimes we are
also fooled by appearance,

381
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:55,822
and we don't know who is a bad friend,
who is a good friend,

382
00:25:55,822 --> 00:26:01,127
and who is really, really good for us,
who is really bad for us.

383
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:05,432
Or who has ulterior motive
being our friend,

384
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:09,969
to want to be our friend,
things like that; it’s very difficult.

385
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:13,206
So many rich people or famous people,

386
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,675
they have tons of followers,

387
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:19,946
sweet talker and friends,
so-called friends, and all that.

388
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:26,486
And then you see that
quite a few of them

389
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:34,461
fall into a very detrimental lifestyle,

390
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:39,499
drugs, alcohol and abusive substances
and all that.

391
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:44,871
And some of them even end up
losing their life.

392
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:50,410
Quite famous, beautiful people,
young, wonderful people.

393
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,746
Many, you know that.

394
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:56,850
You read it in the newspaper, on TV.

395
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,917
This is a pity.

396
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:02,355
This is the thing about drugs,
alcohol, and that.

397
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,260
People always argue and say,

398
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,929
"Oh, we just take a little alcohol,
it doesn't matter.

399
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,699
We stay at home; we don't go out
and make any trouble."

400
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:15,835
But it starts always little.

401
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:20,040
It starts there
and if you can stop, then it's OK.

402
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,341
But you cannot.

403
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,743
Slowly and then because of drinking,

404
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:28,181
you attract the similar kind
of friends or buddies

405
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:30,650
and then it gets worse, gets worse.

406
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,320
And that's why people,
when they want to stop drinking,

407
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,955
they stop seeing these friends also.

408
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:39,626
Otherwise they cannot stop.

409
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:43,930
Or the smoking people,
when they want to stop smoking,

410
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:48,168
they stop, they try to avoid
the smoking group of people.

411
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:50,837
Otherwise they fall back again.

412
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,608
I saw some young people,

413
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:59,479
when I sometimes go out
in the restaurant and all that.

414
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:02,782
And then sometimes they told me things,

415
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:07,253
like the waiter, waitress,
they told me, they told me just talking,

416
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:14,361
and then I found out that so young,
only 18, already drinking a lot of…

417
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:17,364
because they told me how good is it,
this and that drink. And I said,

418
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,967
"Oh my God, you're so young!
Why are you drinking?"

419
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,236
He said, "Oh, because I like it."

420
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:26,106
I said, "But it's no good for you,
you know that."

421
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:31,911
He said, "Yes, but I'm still young,
I can still recover.

422
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:36,583
So it's better I drink now
than I drink when I am older."

423
00:28:36,583 --> 00:28:40,320
I said, "But when you're older
you cannot stop anymore

424
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,921
because you're used to it.

425
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:43,590
Now you already like it.

426
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,127
Imagine if you keep drinking
like this until you're old.

427
00:28:47,127 --> 00:28:50,130
Then how will you
be able to stop then?"

428
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:54,701
But they just reason with me, saying,
"Oh no, no problem. I can stop anytime."

429
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:56,469
I doubt it very much.

430
00:28:56,469 --> 00:29:00,607
Smoking together and drinking…
smoke and drink together.

431
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:06,446
Imagine that.
But of course they don't listen to me.

432
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:09,482
But I still did say it,
every time I saw it I said it,

433
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:12,686
and sometimes it worked.

434
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:20,727
There was one… I went to eat
sometimes a vegan pizza.

435
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,395
I went to that shop sometimes

436
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,698
and because I gave good tips
they liked me,

437
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:27,133
so they trusted me
and all that, very good.

438
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:34,941
And then one of the waiters,
he worked in another restaurant,

439
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:37,711
but he had his girlfriend
in my restaurant.

440
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,947
His girlfriend liked me very much

441
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:44,884
because I was very polite to them
and I gave good tip,

442
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:47,253
and so she introduced me.

443
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:50,590
That day he was not working,
but he went to her restaurant,

444
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,095
and was drinking something
and smoking, waiting for her.

445
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:56,830
So she, because she liked me,

446
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:00,600
so she said,
"That's my boyfriend there."

447
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,769
And then I looked at him,
he was smoking

448
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:05,138
and drinking some alcohol.

449
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:08,541
So I said, "Hey, handsome!

450
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,610
What are you doing?

451
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,479
You like smoking, drinking?"
He said, "Yes."

452
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:17,450
I said, "Well, but you're
too handsome to do this."

453
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,685
And he said, "I know."

454
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:22,088
Because I called him handsome,
so he liked it.

455
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:27,494
And very sweet,
like a sister talks, or like a girly talk.

456
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,929
And he liked it.
They like me to call him handsome.

457
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:34,100
I said, "Oh you're too handsome
to do this.

458
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,571
This smoking, drinking
will make you wrinkle quickly

459
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:42,976
and then diminish your intelligence.

460
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:47,047
And then what will you do
with the girlfriend?

461
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:52,519
You'd better stay strong,
healthy, for your girlfriend.

462
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,055
And maybe you marry her
and then you have children

463
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:58,725
and then look at all the money
you spend on alcohol and drink.

464
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,060
You work so hard.

465
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,362
I know you're a hard-working person,
right?"

466
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:04,864
He said, "Yes, yes, yes,
I work hard for the future."

467
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:10,437
I said, "Yes, then you should save hard
for the future, because now you can.

468
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:14,874
What if you… tomorrow
you cannot work anymore, then how…

469
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:18,945
what happens to your girlfriend
or your wife or your future generation,

470
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,847
your future children and all that?"

471
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:25,518
And he said, "I know, I know,
but I, I got used to it."

472
00:31:25,518 --> 00:31:29,556
I said, "Yes, I know that,
but it's just a habit.

473
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:34,294
If you stop, maybe you
acquire another habit. You could try."

474
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:35,762
Two weeks later I came back,

475
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:40,433
he said he stopped already
two weeks now. (Wow!)

476
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:46,206
And also another taxi driver
and another, another.

477
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,942
I cannot change
the whole world but wherever I go…

478
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:51,277
And then another two months later
I came back,

479
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:55,715
he was still was not smoking. (Wow!)

480
00:31:55,715 --> 00:32:02,722
Yes, and also that taxi driver,
also, because I scolded him.

481
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:05,392
I give him very good tip,

482
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:08,461
so he also knows I'm a good person.

483
00:32:08,461 --> 00:32:11,731
Then, because one time
he brought his son…

484
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,533
I told this story already, I think. (Yes.)

485
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,036
Then we don't bore you again.

486
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:22,142
And after many months I came back
the year after, he was clean of smoking.

487
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:25,712
But it was too late for his son,
his son was still smoking.

488
00:32:25,712 --> 00:32:27,047
Because his son said

489
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:30,116
his friends are all smoking,
if he stops now it looks weird.

490
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,553
This is the problem,
with children,

491
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:37,123
teenager, they're proud
to be like everybody else.

492
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:40,760
"Are you chicken or what?"

493
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,631
And if you stop smoking
they will exclude you from their club,

494
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,467
whatever club that can be.

495
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:50,070
And then you're not cool anymore.

496
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,473
For being cool,
they're killing themselves.

497
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:57,510
This is terrible, terrible.

498
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,948
But nowadays
because of the smoking law,

499
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:06,653
somehow the children
know that it's bad now.

500
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,254
Look at that, the government steps in

501
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:11,524
and then it becomes like legal
not to smoke.

502
00:33:11,524 --> 00:33:14,227
And then so they
can have good excuse.

503
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:20,734
Somehow the number of younger smokers
is reduced and drinkers also reduced.

504
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:22,802
Some pubs close.

505
00:33:22,802 --> 00:33:28,441
Some pubs close, no one drinks a lot,
especially younger people.

506
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:31,311
I'm glad, of course we cannot
change the whole world overnight,

507
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,981
but it's some sign of change.

508
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:38,184
Whatever I can do,
anywhere I go privately,

509
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:42,122
I'm happy that it has
some effect on their people.

510
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:44,391
I scolded him, I said,
"Look at you, you smoke

511
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:47,961
and then that's why
your son learns after you.

512
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:50,096
You should be a better example.

513
00:33:50,096 --> 00:33:53,633
You know how smoke
causes your cancer

514
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:56,803
and makes you die early
or makes you unable to work.

515
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,806
And your son, look he's only 15

516
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:02,008
and you already give him
cigarettes like that,

517
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:04,911
you smoke together
like buddy-buddy.

518
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:08,915
And then suppose you have cancer
or something next year,

519
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:10,550
who is going to take care of your son?

520
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,652
You're divorced,
he doesn't have a mother,

521
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:15,889
he relies on you and you make
a very bad example as a father.

522
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,957
I'm sorry if you're angry with me.

523
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:21,327
I have to tell you that
because I'm worried about your son."

524
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:24,230
And he stopped smoking
ever since then.

525
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,833
And I said, "How about your son?"

526
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,401
He said, "Sorry, he's still smoking

527
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:32,205
because it's not cool to stop in school."

528
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:33,640
"But at least," I said,

529
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,778
"at least you stopped
and maybe he'll follow."

530
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:43,683
So I bought him a Jesus cross,

531
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:47,821
silver, with a chain to hang on the neck.

532
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:52,192
I said, "This is to remind you,"
just to reward him,

533
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:54,627
I said, "This is to congratulate you."

534
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:58,398
One year later I met him on the street.

535
00:34:58,398 --> 00:34:59,165
"Congratulate you

536
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,435
and then to remind you
not to fall back on smoking again.

537
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:04,971
Every time you want to smoke,
you touch the cross

538
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:08,208
and you pray to Jesus.
That's much better for you."

539
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:11,578
And then he liked that, and then,
I think he's still not smoking.

540
00:35:11,578 --> 00:35:14,114
If one year, more than one year
he stopped smoking

541
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,383
then I am sure he'll be able to continue.

542
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:20,553
I say, "You have to be healthy
and strong for your son.

543
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:24,257
He's very young;
he has no mother now and only you.

544
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:29,229
And if you don't work,
what's going to happen to him?”

545
00:35:29,229 --> 00:35:32,232
So he stopped.

546
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:34,768
Well, never mind.

547
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:39,205
And now we go back to India
with the Buddha. (Yes.)

548
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,478
I don't know how many more
I've said about smoking.

549
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:49,949
Everywhere I go, if I see that,
I tell them right away.

550
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:53,586
It's strange like that;
they're not angry with me even.

551
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:56,623
I thought I risk,
because strangers

552
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:59,426
sometimes I see in the restaurant,
I don't even know them,

553
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,995
they just sit next to my table.

554
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:05,198
I have actually no right
to tell them what to do.

555
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:06,433
I thought they're going to be angry,

556
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:10,036
but they all feel very apologetic.

557
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:13,740
They say, "Yes I know, I know, I've tried."

558
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,011
I say, "Try again, try again."

559
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:22,082
I talk sweetly. I don't say,
"Hey, no good, no good, no good."

560
00:36:22,082 --> 00:36:23,850
Only that taxi driver,

561
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:31,391
because he was driving me
from my house to the city.

562
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:35,595
And then while we're passing
the path, mountain roads,

563
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:38,498
that his son was cutting grass
from my house,

564
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,867
he took the cigarette
and gave it to his son.

565
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:46,840
That's why I saw it, I said,
"This is…" I was really angry.

566
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,841
I was really angry.

567
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:51,511
Until then I didn't know that
he encouraged his son to smoke.

568
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:55,348
He passed by
and gave him one cigarette,

569
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,917
meanwhile we're waiting
for him to come back.

570
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:02,022
That's why I was angry,
so I really gave him… I gave it to him.

571
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:04,324
But the rest, because I don't know them,

572
00:37:04,324 --> 00:37:05,992
I'm very sweet.

573
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:11,131
I say, "Oh, you've such a beautiful
and lovely skin. Why do you smoke?

574
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:13,833
You're going to destroy it.

575
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:18,638
Do you know how much the people pay
to have their skin beautiful?

576
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:22,008
You have such a beautiful,
beautiful face and pure skin.

577
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:24,477
I wish I had it.
And now you're smoking,

578
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:29,049
and soon, in several years
your skin will be very, very bad."

579
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:36,089
And that like motivates people,
something like that.

580
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:40,093
I don't always scold them
when smoking, no, no, of course not.

581
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,261
I feel sorry for them.

582
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,864
Only that taxi driver
because he had a son only 15.

583
00:37:44,864 --> 00:37:48,301
His son was only 15,
I didn't know he was doing this.

584
00:37:48,301 --> 00:37:49,936
To take out a cigarette
and give it to him like that,

585
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:55,041
like it's a natural thing,
like a candy or something.

586
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:59,446
Then I was very angry
because of the son.

587
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:02,082
But then he stopped smoking.

588
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:05,385
I was impressed
when I saw him again.

589
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:09,322
I hugged him and said, "You're a good,
good father, good boy, good boy."

590
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:11,458
And I immediately
went to a jewelry shop

591
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,295
and bought him a cross,
silver, it was not expensive,

592
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:22,669
it just happened to be
Father's Day. (Wow!)

593
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,071
So I gave it to him,

594
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:28,174
and I told him all this to encourage him,

595
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:30,577
to strengthen his power
to stop smoking,

596
00:38:30,577 --> 00:38:33,213
because his son was still smoking
in his house

597
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:36,916
and that was very difficult
for him, to quit.

598
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,786
But he still did that.
So he's really a hero.

599
00:38:39,786 --> 00:38:43,089
I said, "You are a hero father.
Not just a normal father."

600
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:45,892
I said, "I know it's very difficult
for you to stop smoking.

601
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:51,698
You are good, good, good,
really, really," like that.

602
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:57,804
All right, we go back to India,
the Buddha stuff;

603
00:38:57,804 --> 00:39:00,573
enough with negative stuff.

604
00:39:00,573 --> 00:39:02,609
Talk of positive, but this is also negative,

605
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:10,150
that's why it brought me
to tell you this kind of thing.

606
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,453
You see, now parents die.

607
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:17,691
And they know it,
these bad people, they know it.

608
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:21,094
And he was just married,
and then now he knew this.

609
00:39:21,094 --> 00:39:23,763
He was still young,
this boy was still young.

610
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:27,133
They knew they could seduce him now.
The parents were no longer there.

611
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:31,237
Both parents died.
Only wife and husband left.

612
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,839
And innocent people,

613
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:38,378
being brought up
in a very good family.

614
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:46,119
Now, so, they just sweet talk him.

615
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,754
They didn't say, "Drink this,"
or anything.

616
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:51,024
They just said,
"Oh, you are a good boy."

617
00:39:51,024 --> 00:39:56,329
"Your blessing will make us
have a better life," and all that.

618
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:58,865
And so he asked,
"What are these men drinking?"

619
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,500
and the servants said to him,

620
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,304
"Oh, Master, they are drinking
some kind of drink." Of course.

621
00:40:04,304 --> 00:40:06,306
And then he said, "Does it taste good?"

622
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:10,310
They said, "Master,
in this world it's the best."

623
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,913
So the youth, the boy… you must know,

624
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:17,884
even though he was married,
but in India they married young,

625
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:22,422
even 15, 16 already.

626
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:30,964
So both of them were still teenagers,
so in that case said the youth,

627
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:35,502
the son of the treasurer said,
"I must have some, too."

628
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:38,371
Of course it tasted good, he liked it.

629
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:41,775
So he called the page,
meaning the servant,

630
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:45,211
to bring him first a little,
and then a little more,

631
00:40:45,211 --> 00:40:48,815
and then he drank them all.

632
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:55,422
Now in no long time, those knaves,
the bad ones,

633
00:40:55,422 --> 00:41:00,727
discovered that he had taken up
the habit of drinking.

634
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:03,463
Then they flocked around him.

635
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:06,700
As time went on,

636
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:12,505
the crowd that surrounded him
increased in numbers, of course.

637
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:14,908
This is the result.

638
00:41:14,908 --> 00:41:19,479
Now they got themselves
into his life so easily,

639
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:25,051
as smooth as these cocktails, alcohol.

640
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:31,558
And then, this boy, the youth,
the son, would spend

641
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:40,600
a hundred or two hundred pieces
of money at a time on strong drink.

642
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,671
It became a habit with him after a time,

643
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:51,144
wherever he happened to be,
to pile up a heap of coins

644
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:56,282
and call out as he drank,
"Take these coins and fetch me flowers.

645
00:41:56,282 --> 00:41:59,052
Take these coins
and fetch me perfumes!

646
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:03,523
This man is clever at dicing
and this man at dancing,

647
00:42:03,523 --> 00:42:05,191
and this man at singing

648
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:08,728
and this man at the playing
of musical instruments.

649
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:12,699
Give this man a thousand
and this man two thousand!"

650
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:17,303
Thus did he spend his money,
and now you know the rest.

651
00:42:17,303 --> 00:42:20,006
Soon he had no more.

652
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:26,913
In no long time he squandered
all the 80 crores of treasure

653
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:30,016
that formerly belonged to him,

654
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:32,519
meaning millions.

655
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,722
He was a millionaire,
a kind of very rich millionaire

656
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,691
and now he squandered it all,

657
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:43,163
all the money
left by his parents.

658
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:49,035
So, then those knaves
said to him,

659
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:55,308
the bad group of people
that slid into his life, said to him,

660
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:59,946
"Master, your wealth is all spent."

661
00:42:59,946 --> 00:43:03,750
So then he said,
"Has my wife no money?"

662
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,685
You know, the young boy.

663
00:43:05,685 --> 00:43:10,590
And then they replied,
"Yes, Master, she has."

664
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,526
"Well then, fetch that, too."

665
00:43:13,526 --> 00:43:16,529
Fetch the money
from his wife's treasure.

666
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:22,802
And he spent all his wife's money
in precisely the same way.

667
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:30,577
This is to be expected.

668
00:43:30,577 --> 00:43:35,582
I knew it would come,
as if I had read the story before.

669
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:37,650
I didn't read the story before.

670
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,320
It's the first time I read it today
in front of you.

671
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,357
It's also the first time I knew about it.
But I knew it would happen.

672
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:49,796
After drinking,
things will become like that.

673
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:53,600
Drinking and maybe also,
drugging, stuff like that,

674
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,205
to make it stronger, more,
more feeling, whatever.

675
00:43:59,205 --> 00:44:04,010
All right. As time went on,
he sold his fields and his parks

676
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,547
and his gardens and his carriages.

677
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:15,188
He even disposed of the vessels
he used at meals.

678
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:18,925
All the bowls and everything,

679
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:23,063
which is really like china,
bone china or something precious.

680
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:25,065
It's not just the normal vessels.

681
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:26,800
Are you all right there?

682
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,069
You want to sit down or…

683
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,539
You can go in the front.
There is room.

684
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:36,242
You can sit there. No problem.

685
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:39,379
I saw you're uncomfortable, just sit,
sit here, it's OK.

686
00:44:39,379 --> 00:44:41,514
Sit, sit here, no problem.

687
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:44,551
Everybody knows you. Don't worry.

688
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:45,919
More comfy now?

689
00:44:45,919 --> 00:44:49,522
I was going to pass out.
I thought I was going to pass out.

690
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,658
You pass out? (Yes.)

691
00:44:51,658 --> 00:44:53,360
You did?
(A lot of blessing here.)

692
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,130
Too much blessing?
Then you better sit down.

693
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,499
Because if you pass out
on top of these sisters, then...

694
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:03,937
then it's not too good, my love.

695
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:06,206
You're OK now?
You want a chair or anything?

696
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:06,906
I'm OK, Master.

697
00:45:06,906 --> 00:45:08,842
You can lean on the chair,

698
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:11,911
and put your feet here.

699
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:14,214
And put your feet right here,
don't worry.

700
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:17,450
Let's continue.

701
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:21,721
So, you see, slowly he sold everything.

702
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:27,927
He sold all the utensils that he used
for eating and everything at all.

703
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:30,764
My God, it's terrible.

704
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:40,373
And then he also sold his coverlets,
for riotous living.

705
00:45:40,373 --> 00:45:44,577
And his clothes, and cloaks,

706
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:50,016
his coat, and his couches even.

707
00:45:50,016 --> 00:45:54,087
Not yet, don't sell this one,
I still need it.

708
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:59,559
All right, and then…
it means he sold everything.

709
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,395
All that belonged to him, he sold.

710
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:09,402
And the proceeds he spent
in riotous living, riotous living,

711
00:46:09,402 --> 00:46:14,307
something like that,
in that kind of lifestyle.

712
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:16,643
Riotous or riotous?
(Righteous.)

713
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:20,714
No, not righteous.
No, no, riotous, meaning bad living.

714
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:23,516
(Oh, riotous.)
Riotous living.

715
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:29,522
In old age, he sold his house,
the property of his family.

716
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:35,862
And those to whom he sold his house
took possession of it

717
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:40,700
and straight away put him out,
threw him out.

718
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,972
What do we call it in America?
What's the name of that

719
00:46:45,972 --> 00:46:49,142
when you throw somebody
out of the house?

720
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:51,878
Evicted! (Evicted.)
They evicted him.

721
00:46:51,878 --> 00:46:56,383
That's it, easier for
English people to understand.

722
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:58,818
So they evicted him
out of this house straightaway.

723
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:04,791
Thereupon, taking his wife with him,
oh, poor wife,

724
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:10,764
he found a lodging near the
house wall of other people's houses.

725
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:20,273
With a broken potsherd in his hand

726
00:47:20,273 --> 00:47:22,375
he would go about begging for alms.

727
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:28,648
Finally he began to eat the leavings
of other people's food, leftovers.

728
00:47:28,648 --> 00:47:32,652
Oh my God, my God, that's terrible.

729
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:45,198
One day he stood at the door
of a rest house receiving leftover food

730
00:47:45,198 --> 00:47:49,202
presented to him by young monks.

731
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:52,072
The Buddha saw him and smiled.

732
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:59,446
Thereupon, the elder Ananda
asked him why he smiled,

733
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:01,081
asked the Buddha why he smiled.

734
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:03,083
I'm sorry, camera.
You don't see me?

735
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,319
Oh, somebody crying or sleeping.

736
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,355
No, you don't see me
because of the camera,

737
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:10,857
sorry about that.

738
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:14,427
Because of the computer,
but otherwise your brothers and sisters

739
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:21,001
on the other side of the planet
won't be able to see me.

740
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,802
All right, we can't have everything.

741
00:48:22,802 --> 00:48:26,673
Today it’s raining
and this is already very good.

742
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:31,511
If the Buddha knew what
we were having right now,

743
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:34,681
he would not be able to imagine.

744
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:41,521
At that time he had to walk even.

745
00:48:41,521 --> 00:48:45,458
Maybe sometimes he had
a carriage from the king,

746
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:48,628
but mostly he had to walk
with all the monks.

747
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:55,201
Because too many monks,
they cannot carry them all.

748
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:59,339
Even we have just,
not even a hundred people here,

749
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:04,010
we need how many coaches,
how many cars, caravans, vans,

750
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:08,481
to bring people many times
back and forth, back and forth.

751
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:14,521
And then utensils, and pots and pans,
lucky I did not sell any of that yet,

752
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:16,656
because I didn't drink.

753
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:22,095
You have a good Master here,
a no-drinking Master.

754
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:24,564
My sofa is still here,

755
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:29,202
my bed's still out there for you,
house’s still here.

756
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:33,606
Good, and you still have
a pot and pan to cook.

757
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:39,312
You understood everything,
you over there? (Yes.)

758
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,583
Are you warm enough there?
(Yes.)

759
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:46,219
Did they put heaters for you?

760
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:50,623
I mean the air con,
you can turn into heater.

761
00:49:50,623 --> 00:49:53,560
It's warm enough? (Yes.)
(Warm enough.)

762
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,796
Good, good.
And your rooms also have air con.

763
00:49:56,796 --> 00:49:59,399
All right, it's much better
there than here,

764
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:03,336
especially if you have to
go to the restroom, it's better.

765
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:08,341
Here, it's not possible
because the rain is very hard.

766
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:12,278
With the wind, it flies in all directions.

767
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:16,182
You can't protect yourself with
just a raincoat or with just an umbrella.

768
00:50:16,182 --> 00:50:18,752
It's good you are there,
it's good.

769
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,756
You still can see me anyway, right?
It's not far, right?

770
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:24,758
Yes, not far, Master.

771
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:28,495
My God,
imagine in the Buddha's time.

772
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:30,563
We couldn't have this.

773
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:35,368
The teacher,
the Buddha was smiling

774
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:38,605
and Ananda, Reverend Ananda
asked him why,

775
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:46,946
so the Buddha explained
the reason for his smile.

776
00:50:46,946 --> 00:50:48,882
Saying to Ananda,

777
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:56,022
"Ananda,
just look here at Great Wealth."

778
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:58,858
Great Wealth is the name of that boy,

779
00:50:58,858 --> 00:51:01,661
the one who squandered
all the properties.

780
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:04,531
"The treasurer's son, look at him.

781
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:10,870
In this very city he has squandered
twice 80 crores of treasure,"

782
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,440
meaning many millions of dollars.

783
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,777
Two times even, because one from him
and one from his wife, as well.

784
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:21,381
My God, poor wife!
But this is the Indian wife.

785
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:26,953
We, the westerner wife
or the Asian wife, we don't have this.

786
00:51:26,953 --> 00:51:29,756
We'd throw him out.

787
00:51:29,756 --> 00:51:32,826
Lucky for him,
he married the Indian wife.

788
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:36,396
The Indian wife, the Hindu wife,
never left her husband,

789
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:38,264
but that was before.

790
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:41,968
Nowadays, they go to college,
they drive airplanes, they drive cars,

791
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,805
they make Internet business,
they earn a billion, millions of dollars,

792
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:49,542
they don't care
about the husband.

793
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:52,645
In the former life, in former times,
in Au Lac (Vietnam)

794
00:51:52,645 --> 00:51:57,550
we also praised the wife,
the Japanese wife,

795
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:02,022
so we have a saying like,
"Eat the Chinese food,

796
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:07,193
stay in a French house,
and marry a Japanese wife.

797
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:10,697
These are the best for your life."

798
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:15,235
For a man, his dream, a man's dream.

799
00:52:15,235 --> 00:52:19,105
Nowadays, a Japanese wife is not
the Japanese wife

800
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:21,574
that is in that saying anymore.

801
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:24,310
And the Hindu wife is also…

802
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:30,016
not all of them are as the Hindu wife
like this wife in here.

803
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:33,486
They'd kick you out in no time.

804
00:52:33,486 --> 00:52:37,090
Tell them go out
and beg for chutney outside.

805
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:43,730
Or sushi.
Go out and beg for sushi outside.

806
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:51,037
So, he was saying,
the Buddha continued, saying that,

807
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:54,274
"Now, accompanied by his wife,"
poor wife,

808
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:57,711
they stick to the husband
through thick and thin,

809
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:01,381
"He is begging for alms.

810
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:03,817
For if in the prime of life

811
00:53:03,817 --> 00:53:07,354
this man had not squandered his wealth,

812
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,190
but had applied himself to business,

813
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:17,364
he would have become
the principal treasurer in this very city."

814
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:23,803
The treasurer is taking care
of the wealth of the city

815
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:28,008
or the king's entrusted treasure.

816
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:32,278
But they give this job only
to the wealthy ones

817
00:53:32,278 --> 00:53:38,284
because they know they would
not, how you say… stretch your legs.

818
00:53:38,284 --> 00:53:41,921
They would not steal from
the treasure of the cities

819
00:53:41,921 --> 00:53:44,758
or from the king
because they had enough.

820
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:49,262
That's why his father was entrusted
to the job of treasurer.

821
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:52,899
Stretch it out, stretch
on the other side, whatever.

822
00:53:52,899 --> 00:53:57,170
Be comfy.
Yes, we are at home.

823
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:00,006
And… OK, I do it for you

824
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:04,577
so that you know I also forget
my legs also have gone to sleep.

825
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:08,448
So the thing…

826
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:15,422
That's why he was a treasurer
of the king and the city.

827
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:21,027
But after he lost all his wealth,
he went out begging.

828
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:25,065
He couldn't see the king anymore
and nobody trusted him anymore.

829
00:54:25,065 --> 00:54:30,770
Nobody can trust treasure or money
or possessions or anything of value

830
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,707
to the kind of man who drinks

831
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:37,744
or takes drugs
and squanders his own wealth

832
00:54:37,744 --> 00:54:46,152
and the wealth of his wife even,
so brainless, so idiot like that.

833
00:54:46,152 --> 00:54:47,721
So the Buddha was smiling,

834
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:53,393
saying that if this boy had not
squandered all his wealth

835
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,929
and applied that to do business,

836
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:59,632
then he would have earned double,
triple and more money

837
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:04,070
and then he would have become
the Chief Treasurer even,

838
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:10,343
not just the treasurer,
but even Chief Treasurer of this city,

839
00:55:10,343 --> 00:55:13,046
the Principal Treasurer in this very city.

840
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:17,650
And if he had retired from the world
and become a monk even,

841
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:22,155
he would have attained
Arhatship.

842
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:28,962
What friends you have
drag you down or lift you up.

843
00:55:28,962 --> 00:55:33,333
If he had befriended
the Buddha or the monks,

844
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,168
disciple monks of the Buddha,

845
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:38,171
he would have been lifted up
to Nirvana even,

846
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:39,839
to Heaven, the highest Heaven.

847
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,743
But he befriended these mongrels,
these drinkers.

848
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:45,211
That's why in the Bible it says,

849
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:58,124
Be thou not among the alcohol drinkers
and meat eaters even.

850
00:55:58,124 --> 00:56:05,665
So you befriend whom,
you become whom.

851
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:07,467
So the Buddha even said that.

852
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:10,103
Had he become a monk even,

853
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:14,407
then he would have
attained Arhatship already

854
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:20,313
and his wife would have been
established in the fruit of the Third Path,

855
00:56:20,313 --> 00:56:23,483
also spiritually elevated, his wife.

856
00:56:23,483 --> 00:56:28,755
If in the middle of life
he had not squandered his wealth

857
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:31,958
but had applied himself to business

858
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:34,894
he would have become
Second Treasurer.

859
00:56:34,894 --> 00:56:37,964
Meaning even though late,

860
00:56:37,964 --> 00:56:41,501
but if he applied himself to business
and became richer

861
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:46,506
then at least he
would become the Vice Treasurer

862
00:56:46,506 --> 00:56:49,576
if he didn't do it earlier enough.

863
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:54,514
And if he had retired from the world
and became a monk then,

864
00:56:54,514 --> 00:56:59,519
he would have attained
the fruit of the Third Path

865
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,055
and his wife would have
been established

866
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:04,190
in the fruit of the Second Path.

867
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:05,592
Well, still not so late.

868
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:14,234
Lower level, lower position
but still OK, still not late.

869
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:17,103
If in the later years of his life,

870
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:22,909
he had not squandered his wealth
but had applied himself to business,

871
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:26,379
he would have become
the Third Treasurer,

872
00:57:26,379 --> 00:57:29,015
below the Vice Treasurer.

873
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:33,253
And if he retired from the world
and became a monk,

874
00:57:33,253 --> 00:57:37,424
he would have attained
the fruit of the Second Path

875
00:57:37,424 --> 00:57:42,962
and his wife would have been
established in the fruit of Stream Entry.

876
00:57:42,962 --> 00:57:45,198
Stream, the Sound Stream.

877
00:57:45,198 --> 00:57:50,937
Beginner, the First World.
Astral, at least.

878
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:58,545
The beginning of the Stream,
Sound Hearer. The Sound Stream.

879
00:57:58,545 --> 00:58:03,049
But now he had fallen away
from the wealth of a layman

880
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:10,123
and he had likewise fallen away
from the estate of an ascetic.

881
00:58:10,123 --> 00:58:15,829
He had become like the heron
in the dried-up pond.

882
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:19,065
So saying, he pronounced
the following stanzas.

883
00:58:19,065 --> 00:58:21,501
Buddha pronounced this:

884
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:27,440
Having led neither the holy life
nor riches won while young,

885
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,613
they lingered on like aged cranes,
aged, old cranes

886
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:36,383
around a fished-out pond,

887
00:58:36,383 --> 00:58:40,854
meaning dried-out pond.
Hungry, no fish any more.

888
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:45,458
Having led neither the holy life
nor riches won while young,

889
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:53,600
they lie around like worn-out bows
singing about the past.

890
00:58:54,134 --> 00:58:57,837
Bows. Strings and bows
and singing about the past.

891
00:58:57,837 --> 00:59:00,206
"Oh, I was so-and-so…"

892
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:07,480
"I have had such-and-such…
and I have been doing such-and-such."

893
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:12,185
Always have been, gone,
finished, done, past.

894
00:59:12,185 --> 00:59:15,889
Nothing for now,
nothing for the future.

895
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:28,168
This is the fate of people who have
fallen into the snare of worldly pleasure

896
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:31,438
such as drinking, intoxicants,

897
00:59:31,438 --> 00:59:38,878
and making themselves slaves to
that habit, and then lost everything,

898
00:59:38,878 --> 00:59:44,417
not just their wealth, their health,
their family, their future,

899
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:48,221
but also their dignity,
the most important.

900
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,759
All right, end of story.

901
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:55,428
We thank the Buddha and Ananda.

902
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,901
We thank the Buddha,
Reverend Ananda

903
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:08,141
and all people who helped in translating,
printing, putting on the Internet, etc.,

904
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:12,979
so that we have such a wonderful
reminder of a good life,

905
01:00:12,979 --> 01:00:14,881
to be a practitioner.

906
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:18,084
To be a practitioner is a real good life.

907
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:19,886
Even if you are not rich,

908
01:00:19,886 --> 01:00:25,191
but you are very,
you have abundant treasure inside

909
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:29,095
that nobody can take away from you.

910
01:00:29,095 --> 01:00:34,668
Thank you for being attentive.
(Thank you, Master.)

911
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:37,704
You enjoyed? (Yes, Master.)

912
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:40,607
You don't dare to clap. Why?

913
01:00:46,479 --> 01:00:49,616
You can clap again if you like,
if you're happy.

914
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,321
There's a beautiful song.

915
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:59,192
"If you're happy, clap along…"
Something like that.

916
01:00:59,192 --> 01:01:01,861
I hope you're happy.
You're happy? (Yes.)

917
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:05,432
OK. Very good. Me, too.

918
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:12,505
Now then, we say so long.

919
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,508
Any questions?
People over there, or here?

920
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:22,315
No? No more questions?
Tell me.

921
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:26,386
The girl.

922
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:33,626
Some spiritual thing?

923
01:01:33,626 --> 01:01:35,261
Yes, it's me.

924
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:39,432
Oh, my sister.
What is it, sis?

925
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:47,574
Respected Master,
we'll be leaving tomorrow.

926
01:01:47,574 --> 01:01:50,543
I'd like to represent
our Aulacese (Vietnamese) disciples

927
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:57,784
in wishing you abundant health
and a hundred years of longevity.

928
01:01:57,784 --> 01:02:02,422
More than a hundred years of longevity
to take care of sentient beings. (Oh!)

929
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:08,194
For the Aulacese in particular
and for worldwide disciples in general.

930
01:02:08,194 --> 01:02:09,496
The whole world. (It's all work.)

931
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:11,765
These days,
we've been living in Master's love,

932
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:13,199
so we, the Aulacese
(Vietnamese) initiates,

933
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:16,703
are in such bliss and so happy.

934
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:20,407
We wish to have a chance
to see you again

935
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,643
and listen to your teachings.

936
01:02:23,643 --> 01:02:28,048
This afternoon,
you gave us (non-alcoholic) beer

937
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:29,983
and we enjoyed it so much,
we even got "intoxicated."

938
01:02:29,983 --> 01:02:32,552
Beer without alcohol!
You have to say "no alcohol."

939
01:02:32,552 --> 01:02:34,054
Yes, Master. Vegan beer!

940
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,423
It was so delicious, (Zero alcohol.)
and we had so much fun.

941
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:38,491
Some initiates even brought home

942
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:43,997
to share Master's blessing with
the initiates in Aulac (Vietnam).

943
01:02:43,997 --> 01:02:45,732
And we're so happy.

944
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:49,602
We respectfully wish you
great health and longevity.

945
01:02:49,602 --> 01:02:51,037
That's all, Master.

946
01:02:51,338 --> 01:02:54,741
Thank you.
Thank you, sister. Thank you, guys.

947
01:02:54,741 --> 01:02:58,144
You go home and be well.

948
01:02:58,144 --> 01:03:03,316
Next time, whenever there is a chance,
we'll see each other again.

949
01:03:03,316 --> 01:03:05,652
Goodbye now. (Yes.)

950
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:07,721
Love you.

951
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:11,958
Love you. Bye.

952
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,898
Ciao, babies.
