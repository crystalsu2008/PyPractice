50
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,862
“Loving the Silent Tears”

51
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,796
was a phenomenal show…

52
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,697
If ever the notion of world peace were

53
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,466
to ever find its way to the stage,

54
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,767
it would be in the form

55
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,002
of “Loving the Silent Tears.”

56
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,436
… “Loving the Silent Tears”

57
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,871
happening at the Shrine Auditorium.

58
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,872
The musical “Loving the Silent Tears”

59
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,873
is coming to Los Angeles.

60
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,540
Kay Tse,

61
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,055
the famous singer from Hong Kong,

62
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,342
has been invited

63
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,143
to join the musical in the USA.

64
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:30,944
…internationally known spiritual Master,

65
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,778
Master Ching Hai.

66
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,380
Supreme Master Ching Hai

67
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,639
is a world-renowned spiritual teacher…

68
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,882
… Master Ching Hai.

69
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,050
… it’s called “Loving the Silent Tears.”

70
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,239
Don’t miss the musical

71
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,552
“Loving the Silent Tears”…

72
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,221
Director Vincent Paterson…

73
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,422
… the 19th Anniversary

74
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,656
of Supreme Master Ching Hai Day.

75
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,891
“Loving the Silent Tears.”

76
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,292
This new musical has certainly

77
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,061
made its presence known in Los Angeles.

78
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,229
The Shrine Auditorium

79
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,397
in Los Angeles hosted…

80
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,331
… celebrating the work

81
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,298
of Supreme Master Ching Hai.

82
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,633
Honoring the benevolent work

83
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,835
of the world-renowned spiritual teacher.

84
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:57,904
We’re here live at the red carpet

85
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,739
of “Loving the Silent Tears.”

86
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,240
It’s a musical

87
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:02,393
that brings all the international superstars

88
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,744
to one place – and that’s here.

89
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,687
The Oscar-winning actor

90
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,488
from “West Side Story,”

91
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,390
George Chakiris!

92
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,742
Former Miss USA, Susie Castillo!

93
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,264
... “The Lost Boys,” Corey Feldman!

94
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,600
She’s a Tony winner

95
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,073
for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.

96
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:32,696
Debbie! Debbie! Over here!

97
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,442
Oh my God, you look so beautiful!

98
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,144
I’m so excited! I’m so excited.

99
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,679
It’s like, look at this!

100
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,281
Look what’s happening!

101
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,852
I’m so excited.

102
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,721
The carpet is so lively

103
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,988
and everyone’s ready to go.

104
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,891
It’s just a real celebration of world culture.

105
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,625
What’s amazing

106
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,760
when I was walking down the carpet,

107
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:54,444
there’s so many different cultures.

108
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,162
It’s great to be involved.

109
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,163
I just can’t believe

110
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,698
how big the production is.

111
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,933
Very excited,

112
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,970
there is so much spectacle and warmth.

113
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,270
It’s definitely unlike

114
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:05,629
any other red carpet I’ve been to.

115
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:06,573
How about you?

116
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,408
I’ve been in a couple of them.

117
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,510
The Oscars and the Grammys.

118
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,753
But this is different.

119
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,413
It’s very beautiful.

120
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,180
And you’ve been to

121
00:05:14,018 --> 00:05:15,286
so many different red carpet events

122
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,616
here in Hollywood.

123
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,751
What do you think makes this one

124
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,119
stand out the most?

125
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:19,125
I mean, just,

126
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,154
let’s take a quick look around us.

127
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,888
Look at the outfits, for God’s sake.

128
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,390
Oh my God, it’s beautiful.

129
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,373
Have you ever seen anything like this?

130
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:26,826
THE RED CARPET

131
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,608
Pop icon Jon Secada!

132
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,510
Mr. Secada, straight over here!

133
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,780
And you’re a 2-time

134
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:47,145
Grammy Award winner?

135
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,683
Yes, yes, and I feel very excited

136
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,750
to be a part of this show.

137
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,887
Absolutely. And what made you decide

138
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,222
to get in as part of the project?

139
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,024
I think it’s the message itself.

140
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,026
Very happy that I wrote a song for it

141
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,294
along with the Supreme Master.

142
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,162
When I read the poem,

143
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,230
the message kind of spoke for itself:

144
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:05,892
love, forgiveness, understanding.

145
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,167
Those messages we need today

146
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:07,174
more than ever.

147
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,368
Absolutely.

148
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,203
And those messages are so universal.

149
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,004
We can relate to them

150
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,238
no matter what culture we’re from,

151
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:12,706
right?

152
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,007
No matter what.

153
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,579
I’m here at the renowned

154
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,980
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

155
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:21,567
It has held the Oscar

156
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,817
and Grammy Award ceremonies.

157
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,353
“Loving the Silent Tears” will soon

158
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,887
premiere at this auditorium.

159
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,226
We can say that the most professional,

160
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,395
most beloved, most successful people

161
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,163
in theatre and the musical world

162
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,231
are here today.

163
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,532
Grammy Award winners,

164
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,867
Tony Award winners,

165
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,036
directors and producers and composers

166
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:43,770
who have won awards

167
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,445
from all around the world,

168
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,473
pouring their hearts and souls

169
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,674
into one musical.

170
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,410
Emmy-winning Doug Katsaros!

171
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,850
Creative collaborations can be tough,

172
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:59,132
and this one was just magical.

173
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:01,767
It’s an astonishing group of people

174
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,390
that they have pulled together.

175
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,625
Emmy-winning choreographer

176
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,893
of “High School Musical,”

177
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,528
Bonnie Story!

178
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,401
… and Madonna’s world concert tours,

179
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,835
Vincent Paterson!

180
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,271
The execution from Vincent Paterson.

181
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,905
I mean, he worked

182
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,507
with Michael Jackson for 17 years,

183
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,408
c’mon!

184
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,409
You know, it’s amazing.

185
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,344
Bonnie Story’s choreography,

186
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:26,546
the arrangements from Doug Katsaros,

187
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,715
all the composers, Oscar, Emmy,

188
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,151
Tony winners, Grammy winners,

189
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,585
and little old me.

190
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,221
Yeah. It’s a thrill.

191
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,424
Two-time Oscar winning composer

192
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,626
Al Kasha!

193
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,530
Here, Mr. Kasha!

194
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,087
I created the show.

195
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,765
I wanted to think of a show

196
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,334
that would reach the whole world,

197
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,936
16 countries and 6 continents.

198
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,604
Dance styles are very different

199
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,539
in different countries.

200
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,541
How did you even start

201
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,942
putting together a choreography piece

202
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,643
for this?

203
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,746
Well, I did a lot of research.

204
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,681
A lot of research.

205
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,688
Jody Watley, Grammy-winning pop...

206
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,152
Jody!

207
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,288
Vincent Paterson as our director…

208
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,656
It’s a dream come true for me

209
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,558
to have met him now

210
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:12,726
and worked with him.

211
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,693
It’s been nothing but joyful

212
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,694
and full of love.

213
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,463
So, I hope that comes across

214
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,230
to the audience,

215
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,658
and I hope they feel the same way

216
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:19,833
that we do.

217
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,703
Look at this! Beautiful!

218
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,772
There is such beautiful energy here.

219
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:26,906
The atmosphere is bursting

220
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,741
in excitement

221
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,709
as thousands of theatregoers arrive,

222
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,644
including Hollywood celebrities.

223
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,779
This musical has assembled

224
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,315
many Broadway stars

225
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,583
and famous singers

226
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,550
from around the world.

227
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:38,690
Now, let’s see who will show up

228
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,587
on the red carpet.

229
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,704
It’s going to be a beautiful night, everyone.

230
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,333
This is all about peace, love, and goodwill.

231
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,768
So tonight I am an ambassador

232
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:55,635
for all three.

233
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,237
Before I was on “NCIS: Los Angeles,”

234
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,505
I was on Broadway,

235
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,540
so music and theatre and dance

236
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,589
is very a part of me.

237
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,243
Showed a lot of interest in this show,

238
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,044
heard a lot about it,

239
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,345
so I thought I’d come down

240
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,080
and enjoy the arts.

241
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:11,579
Star of “Leave It to Beaver,” Jerry Mathers!

242
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,086
This is going to be a very interesting event.

243
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,187
It’s so multicultural.

244
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,722
There are so many different things

245
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,524
that are going to be going on in this show,

246
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,459
so many very, very talented people,

247
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,727
that I can’t wait to see it.

248
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,961
I wouldn’t have given this a miss

249
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,562
for anything.

250
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,863
I’ve been looking forward to seeing this

251
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,898
ever since I heard about it.

252
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,733
Really great.

253
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,567
I’ve never been to anything

254
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,234
like this before.

255
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,291
I just came like three days ago from Paris.

256
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,306
Did you come particularly for this event or?

257
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,009
Definitely, I did. Just for this event.

258
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:38,812
I enjoyed your work on “Chuck”

259
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,647
for many years. You’re fantastic.

260
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:41,481
What made you want to be

261
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,282
a part of this event?

262
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,984
It was based on just a feeling that

263
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,885
I should be out here,

264
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,687
and hopefully I’ll learn something.

265
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,757
Siavash!

266
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,093
Persian pop superstar!

267
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,695
The energy is wonderful.

268
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,529
And bravo,

269
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,298
Supreme Master Ching Hai.

270
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,432
Such a beautiful poem.

271
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,667
This is a semi-historical situation

272
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,935
for this one piece.

273
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,504
We have representation of Iran,

274
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:05,839
of Lebanon, and Israel

275
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,607
for the first time on stage together.

276
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,342
Award-winning singer of peace,

277
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,844
Liel Kolet!

278
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:13,046
… Camellia Abou-Odah!

279
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,415
It’s time for people to embrace

280
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,984
the higher concept of peace.

281
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,886
This is a really powerful moment for me,

282
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,354
and just to be able to sing with them

283
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,222
on the same stage

284
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,324
is just a proof that

285
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,326
we can have peace in this world.

286
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,363
See, when politics puts walls between us,

287
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,264
I think it is a good time

288
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,299
to break the walls with music.

289
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,468
… “Baywatch,” Kelly Packard!

290
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,371
Do you follow the teachings

291
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,939
of Master Ching Hai?

292
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,207
Yes, I am a big fan.

293
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,676
And I think she’s so wonderful

294
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,910
and so eloquently spoken.

295
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,492
And this is going to be beautiful

296
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,980
to be able to take her words

297
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:47,266
and make them into a musical.

298
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,015
I got a copy

299
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:51,017
of the “Silent Tears,” the poems,

300
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,385
and I just was floored.

301
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:53,653
Her and her teachings,

302
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,355
it’s so beautiful.

303
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,690
Absolutely peace and love,

304
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,304
I mean, she just emulates that.

305
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,294
When you’re inspired by poetry

306
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,930
in the way that Al Kasha was,

307
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,194
tremendous things happen.

308
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,433
I am very honored to be a part

309
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,667
of this extraordinary event

310
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,803
and celebrating the 19th Anniversary

311
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,670
of [Supreme Master] Ching Hai Day.

312
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,203
Today’s event is a beautiful, spiritual,

313
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,607
uplifting, amazing…

314
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,110
It’s a true representation of world peace

315
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,946
and all beings being one.

316
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,081
All beings on this planet have the right

317
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:22,816
to live in peace and harmony together.

318
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,550
That’s right.

319
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:25,123
Dignified, prestigious event.

320
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,420
Supreme Master Ching Hai

321
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,311
is high on my list.

322
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,093
Anybody who services love, peace,

323
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,662
goodwill towards men, to fellow man,

324
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,163
is right up there in my book.

325
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,598
Supreme Master Ching Hai!

326
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,799
My name is Gina La Piana,

327
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,568
we are so pleased and honored

328
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,503
to be here to share your day with you.

329
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,405
Greetings, Supreme Master Ching Hai!

330
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,040
Supreme Master Ching Hai,

331
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:48,339
Happy Anniversary. Congratulations.

332
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,576
Congratulations

333
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:50,977
on your 19th Anniversary

334
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,912
for Supreme Master Ching Hai Day.

335
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:53,713
What a great job.

336
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,248
Happy that this wonderful day has

337
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:55,982
come to pass.

338
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:58,151
You are a beacon in the world today.

339
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:58,952
And I’m very proud

340
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,820
of what you’re doing for everybody.

341
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:01,417
… and tell her

342
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,390
I’m a big fan of her work.

343
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,048
Thank you for all you do

344
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:05,131
to bring compassion

345
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,593
to our wonderful world.

346
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,828
We think that you’re just wonderful.

347
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,429
Congratulations

348
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,697
on your 19th Anniversary.

349
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,032
I’m looking forward to 90.

350
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,333
Supreme Master Ching Hai Day,

351
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,567
this is a fabulous event

352
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,969
and we’re honored to be here.

353
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:16,670
I’m really here

354
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,502
to celebrate the 19th Anniversary

355
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,473
of the Supreme Master.

356
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,742
I think it’s great, a great salute.

357
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,910
And I think it’s a great salute

358
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,492
to the Supreme Master.

359
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,148
Golden Globe and Emmy winner

360
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,249
Brenda Vaccaro.

361
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,117
I’m looking to find my inner peace.

362
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,786
If we can’t find our inner peace

363
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,753
after all this…!

364
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,156
Tony-winning actor, dancer, and singer

365
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,491
from “Billy Elliot the Musical,”

366
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,427
Kiril Kulish!

367
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,963
I appreciate everything

368
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,299
Supreme Master has done and is doing.

369
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,867
It’s really, really inspiring

370
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,668
and a great message,

371
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,102
and I think

372
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,171
the whole world needs some of it.

373
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,108
She’s a Chinese platinum pop star

374
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,710
and a vegetarian.

375
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:58,511
Right here, Kay!

376
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,879
Right in front of you.

377
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:01,219
Could you turn this way?

378
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,118
You are a jewel of the Orient.

379
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,486
Wow, thank you!

380
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,588
This is the first time I've attended

381
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,657
a Hollywood red carpet.

382
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,659
I’m very excited.

383
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,562
People from all around the world

384
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:20,667
have come here to support us,

385
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,835
so I’m very happy.

386
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,802
No matter where you’re from,

387
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,237
no matter what language you speak,

388
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:25,638
everyone is looking for a path

389
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,407
to spiritual betterment.

390
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,910
And this musical has embodied

391
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,260
the search that all of us go on:

392
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,114
“What is the meaning of life?

393
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,749
What happens to me?

394
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:36,883
Why am I here?”

395
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,319
I hope that this is the start of a trend.

396
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,287
Aulacese [Vietnamese] pop star

397
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,423
Hồ Quỳnh Hương!

398
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,457
It’s a spiritual journey

399
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,625
from the lead characters.

400
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,660
All the different countries are there

401
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,902
to help them along their way.

402
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,931
Ms. Callaway, over here!

403
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,634
I’m very happy to be

404
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,836
representing the continent of Australia.

405
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,304
It’s going to be fantastic.

406
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,173
Fabiana!

407
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:01,007
I’m from Brazil,

408
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,609
representing my country of Brazil

409
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,777
with the samba.

410
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,611
Can you show us

411
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,945
some sample samba moves?

412
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,247
Sure!

413
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,554
Beautiful!

414
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,423
I’m up in the air

415
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:17,824
playing a harp and singing,

416
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,025
and I have my own troupe

417
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,160
of Irish dancers.

418
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,285
And really, it’s like being a queen.

419
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:25,365
We’re using our cultures

420
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,032
to really share it (the message)

421
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,400
with as many people as possible.

422
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:28,139
So I’m really, really honored.

423
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,971
Korean pop star Brian Joo!

424
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:34,152
Hi, Brian!

425
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:36,109
Oh my God, I want to tell you

426
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,377
I wanted to meet you so much tonight.

427
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:37,844
Oh really?

428
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:38,978
Yeah, because you started

429
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,681
the whole K-pop thing, man.

430
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,616
Look, you have so many fans

431
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,918
surrounding us right now.

432
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,419
This is mind-blowing right now,

433
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,254
I did not expect this at all.

434
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,189
Today, the musical

435
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,990
is about all these international countries

436
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,734
coming together for peace,

437
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,761
and we’re singing poems, the poetry

438
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,496
from Supreme Master Ching Hai.

439
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:58,498
We speak up

440
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,599
for all the Caribbean people

441
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,633
all over the world.

442
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,068
This event is really

443
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,837
a special event for us.

444
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,672
Unity and one love.

445
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:06,639
All respect due

446
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,242
to the Supreme Master Ching Hai.

447
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,914
I love her. I’ve never met her before,

448
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,017
but it would be a pleasure to meet her.

449
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,985
I’d like to really sit down

450
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:20,887
and just look at her.

451
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,591
In the fantasy of the story,

452
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,726
I play this French…

453
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,395
I look a little bit like Snow White,

454
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:31,164
I think, in my dress. I love the dress.

455
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,266
And the song is called

456
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,868
“Accept Me the Way I Am.”

457
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,770
We’re doing it part in French,

458
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:36,844
part in English

459
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,271
so that everyone

460
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,706
can understand the message.

461
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,243
A bit on the left, please, that’s it.

462
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:44,611
It’s not often

463
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,613
that musicals at that level

464
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,700
are conveying a message so powerful.

465
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,686
So I really am glad to be part of this.

466
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:56,693
Also, the proceeds will be contributed

467
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,291
to three different charity organizations

468
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,460
including our friends that need help,

469
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:02,181
the animal care organizations,

470
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,198
so I think it is a big event

471
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,833
that we should support today.

472
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,668
Of course, promoting veganism,

473
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,804
which the Supreme Master is

474
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,038
so wonderful about.

475
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,442
You said you are a vegetarian.

476
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,177
What made you want to

477
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,611
take that step?

478
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,146
Eight years ago, it was something

479
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,715
that I really wanted to try,

480
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,849
being the animal lover and activist

481
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:25,452
that I am. So I just did it.

482
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,153
And I was so amazed

483
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,288
at how much easier it was

484
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,522
than I thought it was going to be.

485
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,824
And I felt, spiritually,

486
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:31,891
I just felt so great.

487
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,560
And I think they’re changing my mind

488
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:34,390
to become a vegan actually.

489
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,696
That’s fantastic!

490
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,564
Because everybody is so happy

491
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,431
and healthy.

492
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,899
Ladies and gentlemen,

493
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:40,934
Patti Cohenour!

494
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:43,536
Mr. Luke Eberl! … Junior Case.

495
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,676
Oh, excited. Just a little nervous,

496
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,311
but it’s okay!

497
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,512
It’s going to be really fun.

498
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,781
It’s a musical extravaganza.

499
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,716
Oh, it’s an extravaganza.

500
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,352
So much to look at, so much to take in.

501
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,086
So I know everyone’s going to

502
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,088
have a wonderful time.

503
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,859
Viewers absolutely cannot wait

504
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,093
for “Loving the Silent Tears.”

505
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,028
What can they expect?

506
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:08,962
They can just expect

507
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,663
the most beautiful,

508
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,366
over-the-top dancing, singing.

509
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,435
It’s a very touching musical.

510
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,304
Maybe you may need one or two tissues.

511
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:18,772
It’s been one

512
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,307
of the most rewarding experiences

513
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,342
of my career,

514
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,277
and I’ve done a lot of great things.

515
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,685
Now, we’ve all seen shows like “Cats”

516
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,286
with singing and dancing,

517
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,688
and this show will have all of that.

518
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,722
But underneath it all,

519
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,090
there is a deeper layer,

520
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:39,044
a spiritual journey, a human journey

521
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,093
that will touch the hearts

522
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:40,960
of its audience.

523
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,929
The wonder, the magic –

524
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,230
that is everything

525
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,625
about “Loving the Silent Tears.”

526
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,638
It’s finally happening.

527
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,874
Ready to work my arms.

528
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,911
This is going to be a spectacular evening.

529
00:17:59,045 --> 00:17:59,846
I think there’s going to be

530
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,315
some real fun surprises as well.

531
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,650
It’s going to be a really unique

532
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,867
and exciting show to watch.

533
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,887
It will be unforgettable.

534
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,922
I just can’t wait.

535
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:09,723
Ready to go!

536
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:10,757
Have fun!

537
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:24,315
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

538
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,941
and welcome
to “Loving the Silent Tears.”

539
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:38,792
Ladies and gentlemen,

540
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,494
please welcome
2-time Emmy Award-winning actor

541
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:43,530
and vegetarian Kristoff St. John,

542
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:47,357
and vegetarian actress
and television host Kelly Packard.

543
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:06,753
Good evening, beautiful audience tonight.

544
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:08,822
And these are gifts from Heaven, right?

545
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:09,489
They sure are.

546
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:13,593
“Silent Tears,” a poetry collection
by Supreme Master Ching Hai…

547
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,995
and the program book
for tonight’s show.

548
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,198
All right, Dream World Cirque,
ladies and gentlemen.

549
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:21,215
The aerialists were Jena Carpenter
and Kyle DesChamps!

550
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:22,836
Give it up for them!

551
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,574
I got to be honest with you,

552
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,877
I am so wishing that
I could fly like that, Kelly.

553
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,145
How many good deeds do you need to do

554
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,114
to become an angel, do you know?

555
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:34,122
I don’t know.

556
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,549
Because if it’s one or less, you know,

557
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,852
I’m totally in. Right?

558
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,888
You do good deeds all the time!
You’re a vegetarian.

559
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,457
Woa! And so are you!

560
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:45,395
All right.

561
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:47,794
Today, we are excited and we are honored

562
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,229
to see all of you here tonight,

563
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,532
including government officials,
media members,

564
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,200
and celebrities among us.

565
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,170
We also want to thank

566
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,270
all of the international fans and media

567
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:59,696
flying in for the fantastic show ahead.

568
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,108
Yes, and we’d like to give a big hallo

569
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,175
to the worldwide viewers
watching live right now.

570
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:05,945
Hallo!

571
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,119
It is, it’s certainly remarkable
in this day and age

572
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,955
with technology
making this truly a global event.

573
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:16,923
A global event, that’s right.

574
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,958
“Loving the Silent Tears,”
the new musical

575
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,694
that we’re all excited to see,

576
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:23,463
it’s a tribute
to a vegan spiritual teacher,

577
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:29,035
a humanitarian, a poet, and an artist,
whose work uplifts and inspires:

578
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,004
Supreme Master Ching Hai.

579
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:36,776
And the show commemorates

580
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,813
the 19th Anniversary
of The Supreme Master Ching Hai Day

581
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,915
to honor her humanitarian works

582
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,017
and advocacy of peace.

583
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:44,951
Yes, and for today’s…

584
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,586
Yes, again, yes.

585
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:54,027
For today’s celebration,
we are joined by an important guest

586
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:55,962
who would like to convey his appreciation

587
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:57,630
to the Supreme Master Ching Hai.

588
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,599
Please welcome California State Senator,

589
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,669
The Honorable Curren Price.

590
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,213
Hallo, it’s an honor to be with you.

591
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:14,781
I want to give you greetings

592
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,383
from the 26th Senate District

593
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,284
here in the State of California,

594
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:20,653
and as chair of the Joint Committee

595
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,122
on the Arts.

596
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,623
It really is a pleasure

597
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,670
to welcome you here
to this wonderful celebration,

598
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:30,897
as we celebrate the grand poetry
and the works

599
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:33,700
of Supreme Master Ching Hai.

600
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:33,012
I think it’s significant

601
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:35,871
that we are here in Los Angeles,

602
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:41,374
the multicultural, multiethnic capital
of the world,

603
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:44,411
and we know that
you will enjoy this program.

604
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:47,747
And it’s an apt
and a very important tribute

605
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:52,452
to a woman who has demonstrated
her commitment to humanity,

606
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,688
to the arts, and to our society.

607
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,823
So I hope you will enjoy the show.

608
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:57,724
Thank you.

609
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:03,930
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

610
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:07,164
please welcome vegan television host,
actress, and former Miss USA

611
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,169
Susie Castillo,

612
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:12,706
and vegetarian award-winning actor
Corey Feldman.

613
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:15,442
Well, hallo there!

614
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,112
How are you all doing?

615
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,616
All the way back there!

616
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,485
It’s great to be here today
with everyone –

617
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:28,488
and of course
with my beautiful co-host Susie.

618
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,323
Well, thank you very much,
Mr. Corey,

619
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,559
and I am excited to be here
on so many levels.

620
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,894
Not only am I a big fan of yours,

621
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:37,430
of course, growing up (Thank you.)
watching your films and everything,

622
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:40,146
but this musical is going to be
absolutely fantastic.

623
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,935
You bet it is. (Yes.)

624
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:42,936
I can’t wait!

625
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:48,174
“Loving the Silent Tears” is based
on the poem collection

626
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:52,178
titled “Silent Tears,” written
by Supreme Master Ching Hai

627
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:54,414
years ago in her 30s.

628
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:58,485
Yes, and 2-time Oscar-winning
composer Al Kasha,

629
00:26:58,485 --> 00:27:00,653
who is here today in the audience…

630
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,414
Very talented man.

631
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,292
That’s right!

632
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:09,729
Al Kasha was actually inspired
by the idea

633
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:11,664
of turning her profound, heartfelt,

634
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,467
and humorous poems into a musical.

635
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,302
It’s really, really so special.

636
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,038
So now, everybody, get ready

637
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,106
for one incredible journey

638
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,242
around the world to 16 countries –

639
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:24,544
all on one stage.

640
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,278
Yes, and thank God

641
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,013
it’s a really big one.

642
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,314
Yes, thank God for that.

643
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,416
We’re going to fit them all on here.

644
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,650
Yes, we are.

645
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,519
Before we enjoy the musical,

646
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,323
we would like to introduce
our very, very special guest speaker.

647
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,350
That’s right. Generations know him
for his Oscar-winning role

648
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:45,465
as Bernardo in the musical film classic,
“West Side Story.”

649
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,837
A living legend.

650
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:55,508
Please welcome
the wonderful George Chakiris!

651
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,184
Thank you.

652
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:10,190
Hallo! Hi, everybody.

653
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,056
Hallo, everybody.
I’m happy to be here this evening.

654
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,528
I have had the privilege

655
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,263
of performing in the theatre

656
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,932
for many years.

657
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:20,567
“West Side Story” was

658
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:23,703
a life-changing experience for me.

659
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:28,541
I’ve loved acting, singing, and dancing
since I was a kid.

660
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,078
And I’m pleased today to tell you
about someone

661
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:35,615
who has a great appreciation for the arts.

662
00:28:35,615 --> 00:28:40,220
She is herself
an accomplished poet and artist.

663
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,157
But she is known throughout the world

664
00:28:42,355 --> 00:28:46,292
as a spiritual teacher and humanitarian.

665
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:52,346
I admire the noble values which
Supreme Master Ching Hai represents.

666
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,768
Today is the celebration

667
00:28:54,768 --> 00:29:00,206
of the 19th Anniversary
of Supreme Master Ching Hai Day.

668
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:07,547
This day was proclaimed in 1993
by Honolulu Mayor Frank F. Fasi

669
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:12,652
who wished to honor her
for her philanthropic contributions.

670
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:14,387
All around the globe,

671
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:16,923
Supreme Master Ching Hai has helped

672
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:20,760
disaster victims, the homeless,
orphans, veterans,

673
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:21,845
and many, many others.

674
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,556
She also loves the arts

675
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,167
because it’s the arts

676
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,436
that bring us together.

677
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,705
We are all here tonight for the premiere

678
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:34,674
of “Loving the Silent Tears,”

679
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:36,771
an international musical.

680
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:40,880
And Supreme Master Ching Hai’s
message is that

681
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:45,127
all beings are the same,
human or animal,

682
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,156
and have the right
to live in peace and dignity

683
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,892
on this beautiful planet;

684
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,495
and that each person can
do his or her part

685
00:29:55,495 --> 00:30:00,734
to save lives, better our planet,
and be heroes.

686
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:03,503
And my personal way to be a hero

687
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:06,006
and save these important,

688
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:07,307
incredible lives

689
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,808
is to be a vegetarian.

690
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,712
It is in this caring spirit that
this celebration

691
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:16,716
of the 19th Anniversary
of Supreme Master Ching Hai Day

692
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:18,385
takes place.

693
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:22,222
And I now invite you
to watch this video greeting

694
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:28,361
by the inspirational lady herself,
Supreme Master Ching Hai.

695
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,396
Thank you.

696
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:48,748
The Inspiration

697
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:57,590
A Message
from Supreme Master Ching Hai

698
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,060
Greetings and love!

699
00:31:00,006 --> 00:31:02,375
My sincere thanks to all

700
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:06,166
who give your heart
to this music assembly.

701
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:09,803
Congratulations to you
and the audience

702
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:13,006
for this rare and joyful event.

703
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:17,410
It is good that we still can celebrate
in whichever way

704
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:21,679
to beautify life on Earth as given by God.

705
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:27,387
It is good that we still love,
still enjoy, still share our goodness

706
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:32,625
to all that coexist
in this world and the next.

707
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,360
It is good that

708
00:31:33,036 --> 00:31:37,240
we still believe in everything
that is noble and positive,

709
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:42,402
and Heavenly power will
definitely prevail.

710
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:48,274
To all involved in this musical event,
blessed be your dedication

711
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:52,579
to make this world
a more enjoyable place,

712
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,180
cheering up the masses

713
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:57,989
and giving thanks
to Heaven and Earth in this way.

714
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:02,088
Though I possibly couldn’t watch the event,

715
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:05,825
and though I am not aware
of the content of this program

716
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:06,926
in advance,

717
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,195
I trust that it will be great,

718
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:13,066
and all who watch it
will enjoy hugely.

719
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:18,505
Sorry there is no high tech where I do
intensive meditation at present,

720
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:24,944
so this simple message will serve
to convey my gratitude to you all.

721
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:28,548
I wish you success, happiness.

722
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:33,687
And as a token of love,
I share with you good news.

723
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:38,525
Maybe just to help pacify
all worrying hearts,

724
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,560
all hearts that are concerned

725
00:32:40,056 --> 00:32:45,595
about the survival and wellness
of all in this world.

726
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,134
And that good news is

727
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:53,228
our planet will still be blessed
to exist for 10,000 years more to come

728
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:58,645
and continue, depending
on our goodness in the future.

729
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,702
And for that praised be God.

730
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:08,254
Thanks to all co-inhabitants’
loving prayers and contributions

731
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,156
in different aspects.

732
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:15,528
As for my humble self,
my humble self also continues her best

733
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:19,232
to support our common united endeavor

734
00:33:19,232 --> 00:33:24,671
to save this planet
for this generation and countless next.

735
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:28,108
Enjoy the show,
thank you all again!

736
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:33,146
May God bless the universe
and protect our world.

737
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:35,248
Love you!

738
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:06,553
Oh, Lord
it’s said that You are everywhere.

739
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:11,758
Why is it that in my house
You never set foot?

740
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:19,699
Oh, Lord the veil seems
forever hanging there,

741
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,835
In front of my eyes.

742
00:38:21,835 --> 00:38:24,537
In front of my eyes.

743
00:38:24,537 --> 00:38:29,275
O Lord of the Blissful Worlds

744
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:33,213
Pray rend it aside!

745
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:37,650
So I may behold Your Face.

746
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:41,403
So I may behold Your Face.

747
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:47,193
O Lord of the Blissful Worlds

748
00:38:49,295 --> 00:38:53,533
It’s said that You are everywhere.

749
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:58,271
Why is it that in my house
You never set foot?

750
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:10,483
You pour light on the entire creation

751
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:15,055
But leave me alone in darkness!

752
00:39:15,055 --> 00:39:23,997
My soul cries and cries
till it finally breaks.

753
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:25,999
You wouldn’t care.

754
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:30,136
You wouldn’t care.

755
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:32,472
Oh, Lord

756
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:36,076
It’s said that You are everywhere.

757
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:41,047
Why is it that in my house
You never set foot?

758
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,555
I know, I’m far from being worthy

759
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:53,026
But I can assure You, no one is!

760
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:57,564
So loving Lord, do not tarry,

761
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,632
Pray pull me out of the dark pit.

762
00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:02,235
Let me live in Your Light.

763
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:05,939
Let me live in Your boundless Grace.

764
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:07,273
Oh, Lord

765
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:10,944
It’s said that You are everywhere.

766
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:14,147
Why is it that in my house

767
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,116
You never set foot?

768
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:24,124
Oh, Lord the veil seems
forever hanging there,

769
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:26,259
In front of my eyes.

770
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:28,862
In front of my eyes...

771
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:33,800
O Lord of the Blissful Worlds

772
00:40:33,008 --> 00:40:36,879
Pray rend it aside!

773
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:43,176
So I may step into eternal Life.

774
00:40:43,176 --> 00:40:49,482
So I may step into eternal Life.

775
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:51,940
Life.

776
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,821
Life.

777
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,469
Diary of Joy?

778
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,671
Anyone? Diary of Joy?

779
00:41:20,028 --> 00:41:24,666
The inner Master:

780
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:29,022
Symbol of eternal Life!
(The inner Master.)

781
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:33,460
The most powerful and gracious
of all beings in the cosmos.

782
00:41:33,046 --> 00:41:37,183
The inner Master.
(The inner Master.)

783
00:41:37,597 --> 00:41:42,235
Some call the Master:
Lord, the Father, Mother,

784
00:41:42,235 --> 00:41:46,573
the Godhead, the Origin of all things.
(The inner Master.)

785
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,875
Some call it the Way,

786
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:55,348
others romantically describe Her
as the beautiful Bride, the Beloved.

787
00:41:55,348 --> 00:41:58,551
Some say it’s your Real Face
before yesterday,

788
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:03,890
the Great Wisdom,
the Perfect Path, Love.

789
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:07,694
Call Him, Her whatever name you like!
(The inner Master.)

790
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:11,572
Frankly, He wouldn’t mind the least.
(The inner Master.)

791
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:14,801
But no matter what it is,

792
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,970
One cannot live without.

793
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:20,234
And the longing to see Her is
the most agony of all

794
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:24,277
Only those who tread the mystic Tao

795
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:25,912
Know the pain of it.

796
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:32,185
And once it is found,

797
00:42:32,185 --> 00:42:34,487
One realizes that

798
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:38,858
one has never known anything
like this (The inner Master)

799
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:42,729
The Way to enlightenment is
through the Light and Sound

800
00:42:43,163 --> 00:42:46,132
The Heaven is within --
here and now!

801
00:42:46,132 --> 00:42:47,133
Here and now!

802
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,401
Here and now!

803
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,003
Here and now!

804
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:51,939
No, it’s not!

805
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:53,506
Yours?

806
00:42:53,506 --> 00:42:54,607
Yes.

807
00:42:54,607 --> 00:42:55,508
Identify it.

808
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:56,943
It’s mine.

809
00:42:57,061 --> 00:42:58,496
“Diary of Joy”?

810
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:00,814
I’m Joy.

811
00:43:00,814 --> 00:43:03,249
Right. Pure joy.

812
00:43:03,249 --> 00:43:06,086
So, did you write that poem?

813
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:09,589
No. I copied it down years ago.

814
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:12,592
It was a foolish thing to do.
It doesn’t mean a thing to me.

815
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,619
Okay. Why are you traveling today?
Visiting family?

816
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:18,131
That’s none of your business.

817
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:20,033
Just passing time.

818
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:22,435
How can anyone tell
where they’re going here?

819
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:24,104
The train schedule’s unreadable.

820
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:27,073
It looks like there’s only one train!

821
00:43:27,073 --> 00:43:30,276
And everyone has such unusual style.

822
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:32,145
So you don’t even know
where you’re going.

823
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:36,416
I was going to the train station.
Just not this one.

824
00:43:36,085 --> 00:43:39,054
I’ve never seen this one before
in my life.

825
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:41,916
It certainly wasn’t the station
I wanted.

826
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,592
The cab driver must have been
completely incompetent.

827
00:43:45,592 --> 00:43:47,360
Where is this train going?

828
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:47,704
Everywhere.

829
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:49,162
No, really.

830
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:50,597
Really, everywhere.

831
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,499
Bye, Dad!

832
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,135
Bye, Dad.

833
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:04,144
Exactly where is this train headed?

834
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:06,179
All aboard!

835
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:09,716
Oh! I want off. Now!

836
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:13,319
You were intending on traveling, right?
Find your seats!

837
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,187
Excuse me, ma’am.

838
00:44:14,187 --> 00:44:16,022
Get your hands off my book!
I mean my bag. Bozo.

839
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:19,025
I’m sorry.
Everyone says I’m clumsy.

840
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:19,959
Everyone’s right.

841
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:22,462
Well, mostly it’s my dad.
He says that.

842
00:44:22,462 --> 00:44:26,299
Grow up, Bozo, and don’t complain
about family to me.

843
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:30,770
And don’t be asking me for a ticket.

844
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:32,546
Dragged off to who knows where.

845
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,674
To magic! Wonder!

846
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:36,142
All sorts of discoveries!

847
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:38,011
Realizations that open the heart.

848
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:39,813
Tickets, please!

849
00:45:29,362 --> 00:45:33,900
Wouldn’t You accept me the way I am?

850
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:37,981
Your hard tests are so difficult to pass!

851
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:43,410
Wouldn’t You accept me the way I am?

852
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:47,045
Your hard tests are so difficult to pass!

853
00:45:48,348 --> 00:45:50,717
You know well what it’s like

854
00:45:50,717 --> 00:45:53,153
You know well what it’s like

855
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:57,757
To live in this dark world
without Your guide

856
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:02,262
Wouldn’t You accept me the way I am?

857
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:08,335
Your hard tests are difficult to pass!

858
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:13,573
I value You alone and no one else!

859
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:18,142
This You must have known since long ago.

860
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:24,484
O Master of heaven and earth,

861
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:27,887
Lord of infinite Love,

862
00:46:27,887 --> 00:46:33,026
High above all sorrows and pleasures

863
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:38,932
You own my very heart!

864
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:49,509
Wouldn’t You accept him the way he is?

865
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:52,645
Your hard tests are difficult to pass!

866
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,885
Wouldn’t You accept her the way she is?

867
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:02,889
Your hard tests are difficult to pass!

868
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:08,661
If You’re not there to hold our hands

869
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:13,700
We’d fail immediately!

870
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:17,645
Wouldn’t You accept us the way we are?

871
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:22,442
Your hard tests are difficult to pass!

872
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:26,312
Accept me just the way…

873
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:31,384
Accept me just the way…

874
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:46,032
Accept me just the way I am!

875
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,174
Nobody accepts me the way I am.

876
00:48:28,174 --> 00:48:30,076
What just happened here?
(Nobody.)

877
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:32,345
Did anybody else see
what happened here?

878
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:33,580
We went through Paris!

879
00:48:33,058 --> 00:48:35,627
I told you! Lots of things to see.

880
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:38,685
It was Paris! Paris, people!

881
00:48:38,685 --> 00:48:42,889
Fabulous scenery!
But there’s more to experience!

882
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:44,657
Would you like a baguette?

883
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:49,118
A glass of “nectar”?

884
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:50,530
Huh?

885
00:48:50,053 --> 00:48:51,388
Would you like some juice?

886
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:56,336
It’s happening again!

887
00:48:56,336 --> 00:48:58,304
Are you hearing this?
Or is it just me?

888
00:48:58,738 --> 00:49:01,574
Or maybe it’s something I had for breakfast.

889
00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:25,665
While I am athirst in the desert of existence,

890
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:29,936
You’re drinking Nectar
somewhere in the heavenly abode!

891
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:32,366
If only I knew the road,

892
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:37,677
I’d go up there and snatch it immediately.

893
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:40,280
O Master,

894
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:42,997
Gloriest of all Glory!

895
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:46,553
Wouldn’t You consider it fair

896
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:50,657
To spill down just a few drops

897
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:51,858
Just a few drops

898
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,493
For me?

899
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,500
If only I know where You hide

900
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:02,107
I’d come running to seek.

901
00:50:05,538 --> 00:50:07,173
But alas! As I’m born blind

902
00:50:07,173 --> 00:50:10,577
Couldn’t climb the highest peak.

903
00:50:10,577 --> 00:50:12,912
Even worse, being deaf and dumb

904
00:50:12,912 --> 00:50:17,250
I can never call, nor hear Your voice.

905
00:50:17,951 --> 00:50:19,552
O Jah (Lord),

906
00:50:19,986 --> 00:50:23,690
You’ve created this poor soul

907
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,538
Everyone would tell me this.

908
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,494
So please take care of it.

909
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:30,163
Or it’ll die alone miserably.

910
00:50:30,463 --> 00:50:31,297
You know it

911
00:50:31,297 --> 00:50:32,632
Too well!

912
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:36,136
You have eyes

913
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:37,871
Come to fetch me.

914
00:50:37,871 --> 00:50:38,972
You have a mouth

915
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:41,274
Please give me a call.

916
00:50:41,274 --> 00:50:43,176
You have ears

917
00:50:43,176 --> 00:50:46,179
Why not hear my plea?

918
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,382
You have eyes

919
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:50,984
Come to fetch me.

920
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:51,985
You have a mouth

921
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:54,387
Please give me a call.

922
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:56,389
You have ears

923
00:50:56,389 --> 00:50:58,858
Why not hear my plea?

924
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:03,830
Master,

925
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,786
I’d like to make a deal with You:

926
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,602
We exchange roles for a few minutes.

927
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:14,001
Then You may discover a deep secret –

928
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:19,512
Or may just remember:

929
00:51:19,512 --> 00:51:22,215
How painful to be separated

930
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:23,683
From Your very Self!

931
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,560
You have eyes

932
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:27,487
Come to fetch me.

933
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:28,488
You have a mouth

934
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,790
Please give me a call.

935
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,115
You have ears

936
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:35,829
Why not hear my plea?

937
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:39,032
You have eyes

938
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:40,767
Come to fetch me.

939
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:41,668
You have a mouth

940
00:51:41,668 --> 00:51:44,037
Please give me a call.

941
00:51:44,037 --> 00:51:46,106
You have ears

942
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:49,109
Why not hear my plea?

943
00:51:50,643 --> 00:51:51,611
You have eyes

944
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:53,913
Come to fetch me.
(O Jah [God]! What are You doing)

945
00:51:53,913 --> 00:51:55,015
You have a mouth

946
00:51:55,015 --> 00:51:56,783
Please give me a call.
(alone in that great Heaven?)

947
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,319
You have ears

948
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:02,722
Why not hear my plea?
(Wouldn’t it be too lonely?!)

949
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:04,824
Why not hear my plea?

950
00:52:04,824 --> 00:52:06,026
O Jah [God]!

951
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:08,061
Why not hear my plea?

952
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:10,497
O Jah [God]!

953
00:52:10,497 --> 00:52:12,599
You have ears

954
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,235
Why not hear my plea?

955
00:52:15,835 --> 00:52:18,304
Why not hear my plea?

956
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,075
Why not hear my plea?

957
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:51,938
Well. Alone at last.

958
00:52:51,938 --> 00:52:54,774
And with my sanity intact.

959
00:52:54,774 --> 00:52:57,711
You got eyes, come and fetch me.

960
00:52:58,378 --> 00:52:59,679
Or not quite.

961
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:02,716
You got a mouth, please give me a call.

962
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:05,218
A pair of drumsticks.

963
00:53:05,218 --> 00:53:07,787
An old sweater.

964
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:09,956
A Diary of Joy.

965
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:12,158
Are you trying to get rid of this?

966
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:14,255
That bozo probably tried to steal it again.

967
00:53:15,128 --> 00:53:17,197
Everything gets taken away from me.

968
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:19,599
Baggage only slows you down.

969
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,501
The best travelers travel light.

970
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:27,340
Of course, you could always get insurance.

971
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:28,102
Property insurance!

972
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:29,476
That’s a good idea.

973
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:32,563
No, no, no.

974
00:53:33,346 --> 00:53:35,982
Spiritual insurance.

975
00:53:35,982 --> 00:53:37,851
Spiritual insurance.

976
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:39,152
For your soul.

977
00:53:39,152 --> 00:53:40,887
My soul needs insuring?

978
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:43,023
Somebody’s stealing my soul?

979
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:49,396
We all misplace things along the way.

980
00:53:50,797 --> 00:53:53,566
Is it getting chilly in here?

981
00:53:53,566 --> 00:53:57,037
Suddenly, yes.

982
00:53:57,037 --> 00:53:59,005
Mercy, mercy.

983
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,643
Better luck in the next life.

984
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:34,074
The Master is more than just Kind.

985
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:39,679
O friends, I could never have enough time

986
00:54:40,513 --> 00:54:51,291
To tell you of His boundless Grace.

987
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:58,631
Only in the remote corner of my heart

988
00:54:58,631 --> 00:55:09,075
I humbly shed tears!

989
00:55:09,075 --> 00:55:12,679
When Thou appearest,

990
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:16,716
The sun seems to fade!

991
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:17,751
Thy being

992
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:26,059
Shining as thousands of stars
and countless jewels,

993
00:55:26,086 --> 00:55:30,323
Thy holy and youthful glow

994
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:43,076
Brighten the darkest corner of my soul.

995
00:55:43,076 --> 00:55:51,151
O my longing heart,

996
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:55,422
Overfilled with joy!

997
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:58,358
And divine gladness.

998
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:02,896
While bathing in Thy infinite Splendor.

999
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:04,464
All worldly burdens

1000
00:56:04,464 --> 00:56:06,466
and sorrows,

1001
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:08,034
depart!

1002
00:56:08,034 --> 00:56:11,041
While bathing in Thy infinite Splendor.

1003
00:56:11,104 --> 00:56:16,242
All worldly burdens and sorrows,
depart!

1004
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:20,447
There is none in this world

1005
00:56:20,447 --> 00:56:32,992
Who’s so full of Love and Mercy.

1006
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:37,597
It would be my great honour

1007
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:40,624
To be just a swallow,

1008
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:45,005
Standing on one leg,

1009
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:50,877
Life after life

1010
00:56:50,877 --> 00:57:09,062
Singing Her praise!

1011
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:53,206
Who is there to praise?

1012
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:57,277
Who? What? Nothing!

1013
00:57:57,444 --> 00:57:59,212
Money!

1014
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:02,229
My father always said
praise money! And I do.

1015
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,218
Where have you been?

1016
00:58:05,218 --> 00:58:06,653
Growing up.

1017
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:10,156
The next car over.
It’s the world of wealth!

1018
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:13,393
I learned all about big-time investing.

1019
00:58:13,393 --> 00:58:15,695
Do you need some financial advice?

1020
00:58:15,695 --> 00:58:18,031
Or a tax shelter?

1021
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:20,166
You got to protect yourself for the future!

1022
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:20,800
Invest right.

1023
00:58:20,008 --> 00:58:22,010
Learn to handle money.

1024
00:58:22,802 --> 00:58:25,705
Bozo, you keep your hands off my money.

1025
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:26,506
Pete.

1026
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:27,207
What?

1027
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:28,641
The name’s Pete, lady.

1028
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:31,478
Whatever. I don’t have time
for boys your age.

1029
00:58:31,478 --> 00:58:34,581
All right. Well,
I am making my father proud.

1030
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:38,118
And nothing is going to get me off track.

1031
00:58:40,032 --> 00:58:41,800
Oh, wow.

1032
00:59:11,785 --> 00:59:14,587
O Lord,

1033
00:59:14,587 --> 00:59:17,824
You have numerous disciples.

1034
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:19,926
I have only You!

1035
00:59:22,262 --> 00:59:24,531
Who is the most faithful of us two?

1036
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,199
I pity myself openly!

1037
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:28,301
I complain openly!

1038
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:32,305
Does anyone hear me? (I do!)

1039
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:35,372
My Master wouldn’t care the least

1040
00:59:35,975 --> 00:59:39,779
Master

1041
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:54,127
Master, You must have forgotten to
use Your human eyes

1042
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:59,532
Now that the heavenly one is
no longer shut.

1043
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:07,040
That’s why You do not see me
in my lonely corner

1044
01:00:07,004 --> 01:00:11,575
Longing to see You.
(I’m longing to see you, too.)

1045
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:17,017
You embrace the glory of the higher worlds,

1046
01:00:17,017 --> 01:00:19,986
It wouldn’t matter

1047
01:00:19,986 --> 01:00:25,990
If I am groveling alone in this dark domain!

1048
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:29,123
O Ye the “perfect” Saint,

1049
01:00:29,996 --> 01:00:34,100
Why are Your eyes lost?

1050
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:45,712
Master! Do You have ears at all?

1051
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:46,646
You must!

1052
01:00:46,646 --> 01:00:50,750
In order to hear my desperate call.

1053
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:51,310
I think...

1054
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:56,723
I’ll buy a pair of human ears for You

1055
01:00:56,723 --> 01:00:59,526
Tomorrow.

1056
01:01:02,362 --> 01:01:09,376
I suspect that
You’ve lost Your heart somewhere

1057
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:16,643
While ascending the heavenly abodes!

1058
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:21,348
Or else You’d recognize my feeling

1059
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:25,385
As my heart is forever hanging

1060
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:26,986
On my sleeves,

1061
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:33,560
Dying to make itself an offering

1062
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:41,631
To You!

1063
01:01:42,135 --> 01:01:43,770
Dearest Master,

1064
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:45,279
Please sympathize with

1065
01:01:45,972 --> 01:01:49,809
All my fellow beings
who are on the same boat,

1066
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:53,813
Who long for Nirvana,

1067
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:59,452
But all they know is samsara.

1068
01:01:59,953 --> 01:02:01,688
Dearest Master,

1069
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:06,026
In the case that
You’ve lost the human heart,

1070
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:13,867
Please take mine.

1071
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:18,004
Please take mine.

1072
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:46,833
Hey, lady, look what I landed!

1073
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:51,237
Oh, Papa will be so proud.

1074
01:02:51,237 --> 01:02:53,773
Floozies, what next?

1075
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:55,975
He’ll figure out how to juggle life.

1076
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:57,610
I know already.

1077
01:02:57,061 --> 01:03:00,565
Oh, hey, watch this, baby!

1078
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:03,550
Yes! Juggle knives!

1079
01:03:03,055 --> 01:03:05,757
Boys your age,
you think you’re immortal.

1080
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:06,886
Men my age.

1081
01:03:06,886 --> 01:03:08,521
Start with oranges.

1082
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:11,104
I could have done it.

1083
01:03:11,725 --> 01:03:13,993
Sure you could.

1084
01:03:13,993 --> 01:03:16,129
And what do you know about me?

1085
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:20,000
I had a son.
You kids think you can do anything!

1086
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,767
I can!

1087
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:23,103
You take stupid risks!

1088
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,238
And your family is left praying for you.

1089
01:03:25,238 --> 01:03:26,573
I’m going to be rich and famous!

1090
01:03:26,573 --> 01:03:28,308
And prayers go unanswered.

1091
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:29,809
And the whole world will know my name!

1092
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:30,877
And there is no God.

1093
01:03:30,877 --> 01:03:32,178
Or none worth forgiving.

1094
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:35,048
And who needs God
when you have money?

1095
01:03:35,048 --> 01:03:37,150
And you end up alone
on a crowded street

1096
01:03:37,015 --> 01:03:39,384
looking for the face you won’t find.

1097
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:11,051
The World is full of troubles

1098
01:04:11,051 --> 01:04:13,753
Only I’m so full of You!

1099
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:18,024
If You were placed within the world

1100
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:21,428
All the troubles would be removed.

1101
01:04:21,428 --> 01:04:24,164
But as the world is full of troubles,

1102
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:27,801
I find no place for You!

1103
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:32,806
No, Lord, I find no place for You.

1104
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:37,043
The World is full of troubles

1105
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:39,412
Only I’m so full of You!

1106
01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:43,550
If You were placed within the world

1107
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:47,253
All the troubles would be removed.

1108
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:50,256
But as the world is full of troubles,

1109
01:04:50,256 --> 01:04:53,927
I find no place for You!

1110
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:59,099
No, Lord, I find no place for You.

1111
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:03,944
If the worldly people know how to love You,

1112
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:10,477
Their pains and sorrows would cease.

1113
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:16,349
But I have discovered, dearest Master:

1114
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:21,221
They’d rather love their pains and sorrows!

1115
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:27,227
Oh, they’d rather love their pains
and sorrows!

1116
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:28,895
The World is full of troubles

1117
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:31,197
I find no place for You!

1118
01:05:31,197 --> 01:05:35,402
No, Lord, I find no place for You

1119
01:05:35,402 --> 01:05:36,936
The World is full of troubles

1120
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:39,439
The World is full of troubles

1121
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:41,741
Only I’m so full of You!

1122
01:05:42,442 --> 01:05:44,611
The World is full of troubles

1123
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:47,147
Only I’m so full of You!

1124
01:05:47,647 --> 01:05:50,250
The World is full of troubles

1125
01:05:50,025 --> 01:05:52,928
Only I’m so full of You!

1126
01:05:53,153 --> 01:05:56,456
If You were placed within the world

1127
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:00,627
All the troubles would be removed.

1128
01:06:00,627 --> 01:06:03,063
But as the world is full of troubles,

1129
01:06:03,063 --> 01:06:06,120
I find no place for You!

1130
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:12,539
I find no place for You.

1131
01:06:37,897 --> 01:06:42,535
Okay. Two cards.
Two cards or three?

1132
01:06:42,535 --> 01:06:46,506
Three cards for my friend
with the fat cigars.

1133
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:48,975
Get lung cancer. See what I care.

1134
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,609
Ignore that voice from the darkness.

1135
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:53,947
We don’t know her.

1136
01:06:53,947 --> 01:06:55,682
Don’t want to know her.

1137
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:58,351
Hey – the pot’s light.

1138
01:06:58,351 --> 01:07:00,220
Who didn’t ante up?

1139
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:06,559
So, yeah, my dad taught me poker.

1140
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,196
He’s a great poker player.

1141
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:13,600
The greatest dad a guy could have.

1142
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:16,043
Taught me how to toss back
five shots of vodka in a row.

1143
01:07:17,904 --> 01:07:21,207
And now we’re killing the liver.

1144
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:22,776
Here, beautiful,

1145
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:25,912
take this and go buy yourself
something pretty.

1146
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:32,203
Hey! Keep your eyes on your cards.

1147
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:36,990
She’s my personal property.

1148
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:39,836
All right, who’s feeling rich?

1149
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:45,565
Who thinks I’m not holding four aces?

1150
01:07:45,565 --> 01:07:49,836
All right. All right, I’ll see your bet

1151
01:07:49,836 --> 01:07:51,604
and I’ll raise you right through the roof,

1152
01:07:51,604 --> 01:07:52,305
and by the end of the night,

1153
01:07:52,305 --> 01:07:55,508
I’ll have enough money
to buy me ten more girls.

1154
01:07:55,508 --> 01:07:58,515
Hey! It’s my one and only!

1155
01:07:58,578 --> 01:08:00,780
I bet she empties your pockets.

1156
01:08:00,078 --> 01:08:02,781
Hey lady! What’s your problem?

1157
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:04,684
Empty pockets!

1158
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:05,485
Empty heart!

1159
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:08,121
Empty mind.

1160
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,151
I found my refuge in You.

1161
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:43,256
And You have promised
everlasting happiness.

1162
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:47,527
This I believe. Indeed I do!

1163
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:52,465
Oh Master, hasten make it true.

1164
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:58,271
For I’m dying in this prison
of the Prince of darkness.

1165
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:00,407
Beloved Master,

1166
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:05,545
You mean more than God to me!

1167
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:13,186
You can move heaven and earth.

1168
01:09:13,186 --> 01:09:18,291
You can change demons
into Angels of Love.

1169
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:23,263
Magician of the greatest worth

1170
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:28,301
Why didn’t You change
this restless monkey mind of mine?!

1171
01:09:28,301 --> 01:09:30,337
Beloved Master,

1172
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:34,240
You mean more than God to me!

1173
01:09:34,574 --> 01:09:37,631
Thy touch turns stone into gold,

1174
01:09:38,144 --> 01:09:42,882
And turns all demons into loving angels.

1175
01:09:43,249 --> 01:09:44,784
Pray mighty Master!

1176
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:46,853
Touch my soul,

1177
01:09:46,853 --> 01:09:52,859
And turn it into Thine own.

1178
01:09:58,231 --> 01:10:00,700
If You don’t love me

1179
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:02,510
I can love no one.

1180
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,705
I know! I know it!

1181
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:07,640
You long have told me:

1182
01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:13,313
“All beings are God’s creatures.”

1183
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:15,715
Beloved Master,

1184
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:17,917
Beloved Master,

1185
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:24,958
You mean more than God to me!

1186
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:42,909
You mean more than God to me!

1187
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:09,831
And thank you so much, gentlemen,
it has been a blast!

1188
01:11:10,704 --> 01:11:11,871
Come on back,
you know where to find me!

1189
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,672
We got to do this again.

1190
01:11:12,672 --> 01:11:14,507
You never know,
you can turn it all around.

1191
01:11:14,507 --> 01:11:16,509
Beginner’s luck, what can I say?

1192
01:11:18,712 --> 01:11:20,847
All right, all right, all right.

1193
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:24,084
Okay. Fifty-seven hundred,
fifty-eight hundred,

1194
01:11:24,084 --> 01:11:28,488
fifty-nine hundred, six thousand…

1195
01:11:28,488 --> 01:11:30,757
No, I had a lot more than this.

1196
01:11:30,757 --> 01:11:32,625
Do you see any?

1197
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:34,527
Did you see any fall on the floor?

1198
01:11:34,527 --> 01:11:36,996
Did it fall in her fist?

1199
01:11:36,996 --> 01:11:38,131
Enough!

1200
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:39,566
Why are you always on me?!

1201
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:44,504
I can’t decide if you’re a smart idiot
or a stupid genius.

1202
01:11:44,504 --> 01:11:46,406
Go pick on your own kid.

1203
01:11:46,406 --> 01:11:47,640
What’s his name?

1204
01:11:47,064 --> 01:11:48,900
Mama’s Little Boy?

1205
01:11:51,544 --> 01:11:53,380
Do you tuck him in at night?

1206
01:11:53,038 --> 01:11:56,574
Does he buy you flowers
on Mother’s Day?

1207
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:59,919
Mr. Boy Scout who doesn’t drink.

1208
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,984
And never gambles.

1209
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:03,990
Yeah.

1210
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,368
I bet he obeys your every command.

1211
01:12:06,393 --> 01:12:09,295
Oh, you have it all so good.

1212
01:12:10,003 --> 01:12:13,139
Yeah, I do have it good!

1213
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:16,069
All you’ve got is a dusty old book

1214
01:12:16,069 --> 01:12:17,604
and some goody-two-shoes son.

1215
01:12:17,604 --> 01:12:21,307
And you’re alive and well
and living on this planet.

1216
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:24,878
At last! Proof there is no God!

1217
01:12:25,078 --> 01:12:26,980
Eye masks, earplugs!

1218
01:12:31,317 --> 01:12:33,186
Who wants to take a nap?

1219
01:12:34,012 --> 01:12:37,683
In silence. Deep meditative silence.

1220
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:37,799
Eye mask!

1221
01:12:38,591 --> 01:12:41,094
Earplugs! I’ve heard enough.

1222
01:12:42,729 --> 01:12:44,364
No charge.

1223
01:12:48,168 --> 01:12:49,969
They’re as hard as rocks.

1224
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:51,705
They’ll soften up.

1225
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,307
Sweet dreams. Say your prayers...

1226
01:12:54,307 --> 01:12:55,709
Wait for answers.

1227
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:57,444
I thought we covered that!

1228
01:12:57,444 --> 01:13:01,147
There is no God,
or none worth waiting for.

1229
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:03,883
Prayers? What a joke.

1230
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:05,318
You want to see miracles happen?

1231
01:13:05,318 --> 01:13:07,620
Keep your eyes right here!

1232
01:13:07,062 --> 01:13:10,299
I’m the answer to everybody’s prayers.

1233
01:13:23,077 --> 01:13:24,478
Sleep tight.

1234
01:14:01,207 --> 01:14:06,291
Hallo Buddha, why do you cry?

1235
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:13,853
In your stone heart how much desire?

1236
01:14:14,487 --> 01:14:20,960
Why do your tears stream down the sea?

1237
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:27,334
Why give your love to the pebble?

1238
01:14:27,734 --> 01:14:34,441
Hallo Buddha, why do you cry?

1239
01:14:34,441 --> 01:14:40,515
In your stone heart how much desire?

1240
01:14:41,181 --> 01:14:47,265
Why do your tears stream down the sea?

1241
01:14:48,021 --> 01:14:55,595
Why give your love to the pebble?

1242
01:14:57,097 --> 01:15:04,471
Oh Buddha, oh Buddha,

1243
01:15:04,471 --> 01:15:11,177
Why did you leave Nirvana?

1244
01:15:17,884 --> 01:15:24,557
What is here to search for?

1245
01:15:24,557 --> 01:15:30,730
Endless pain or sorrow?

1246
01:15:31,164 --> 01:15:37,837
Oh Buddha, oh Buddha,

1247
01:15:37,837 --> 01:15:43,871
Hurry now, leave Samsara!

1248
01:15:44,477 --> 01:15:49,516
Back to where no sorrow

1249
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:54,354
Only joy eternal

1250
01:15:54,354 --> 01:15:59,959
Only love, no border.

1251
01:16:00,493 --> 01:16:07,834
Oh Buddha, oh Buddha,

1252
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:13,740
Hurry now, leave Samsara!

1253
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:19,546
Back to where no sorrow

1254
01:16:19,546 --> 01:16:24,551
Only joy eternal

1255
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:30,490
Only love, no border.

1256
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:34,060
Hallo Buddha,

1257
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:37,843
Why do you smile?

1258
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:44,471
And your stone heart is full of light!

1259
01:16:44,471 --> 01:16:50,535
Why do your arms embrace the world?

1260
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:58,718
Why does your love shine forever?

1261
01:17:00,387 --> 01:17:06,481
Oh Buddha, oh Buddha

1262
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:14,200
Oh Buddha, oh Buddha

1263
01:17:57,031 --> 01:17:58,366
Hey baby!

1264
01:18:00,714 --> 01:18:03,917
Where’s my lucky girl?

1265
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:06,944
Could have used you out here!

1266
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:10,123
I might need to get some of that cash back.

1267
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:19,632
I’ll show you who’s a dimwit gambler.

1268
01:18:19,632 --> 01:18:21,468
You thought this was my life savings?

1269
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:22,669
I got more.

1270
01:18:25,305 --> 01:18:27,574
Not a lot more...

1271
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:30,710
anyway, I’ll win it all back tomorrow.

1272
01:18:34,647 --> 01:18:36,182
The book!

1273
01:18:53,533 --> 01:19:00,407
“Friday: He looks so handsome
in his sleep.”

1274
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:05,412
“He looks so handsome in his sleep!”

1275
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,580
You wrote a book about me!

1276
01:19:07,058 --> 01:19:08,793
Hey, lady!

1277
01:19:09,616 --> 01:19:10,984
Quit that! What are you doing?

1278
01:19:10,984 --> 01:19:12,519
You wrote a book about me!

1279
01:19:12,519 --> 01:19:13,486
I can’t hear you!

1280
01:19:13,486 --> 01:19:16,122
You wrote a book about me!

1281
01:19:16,122 --> 01:19:17,190
You wish.

1282
01:19:17,019 --> 01:19:18,521
In here!

1283
01:19:18,692 --> 01:19:20,026
Where here?

1284
01:19:20,026 --> 01:19:25,765
“Saturday: He turns twenty today.
I pray that angels visit his dreams.”

1285
01:19:25,765 --> 01:19:27,267
Give it!

1286
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:30,503
Ohh. No, this is
about the mysterious son!

1287
01:19:30,503 --> 01:19:32,205
The famous Mister Perfect!

1288
01:19:32,205 --> 01:19:33,206
Give it here!

1289
01:19:33,206 --> 01:19:34,140
Why? What’s so secret?

1290
01:19:34,014 --> 01:19:37,718
Oh, stories from your dark past?
Lovers of the present!

1291
01:19:37,844 --> 01:19:39,279
A black eye in your future.

1292
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:41,047
That’s pretty bold for an old lady.

1293
01:19:41,047 --> 01:19:42,949
Knock-knock!

1294
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:43,983
Missed!

1295
01:19:43,983 --> 01:19:46,519
Safety is an illusion.

1296
01:19:46,519 --> 01:19:51,658
“Sunday – He still sleeps.
And my heart turns black.

1297
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:53,560
Where are you, God?”

1298
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:57,160
Oh, oh, oh – What’s this?
Oh, a poem!

1299
01:19:57,664 --> 01:20:01,868
“I am the mouthpiece
of the entire creation.”

1300
01:20:01,868 --> 01:20:05,171
I’m going to call the conductor.
Conductor!

1301
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:06,673
He’s going to throw you off this train.

1302
01:20:06,673 --> 01:20:09,342
And with any luck, you’ll land in Siberia.

1303
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:37,570
I am the mouthpiece

1304
01:20:37,057 --> 01:20:40,694
Of the entire creation.

1305
01:20:41,207 --> 01:20:43,076
Voicing openly

1306
01:20:43,076 --> 01:20:45,679
Their sorrows and pains

1307
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,617
Of life after life
in the ever rolling wheel of death.

1308
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:56,122
Pray, Compassionate Master

1309
01:20:56,122 --> 01:20:59,959
Hasten to put it to an end.

1310
01:21:01,828 --> 01:21:03,630
I am the mouthpiece

1311
01:21:03,063 --> 01:21:05,599
Of the entire creation.

1312
01:21:06,966 --> 01:21:08,868
Voicing openly

1313
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:10,925
Their sorrows and pains

1314
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:17,143
Of life after life
in the ever rolling wheel of death.

1315
01:21:18,378 --> 01:21:21,781
Pray, Compassionate Master

1316
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:25,952
Hasten to put it to an end.

1317
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:29,485
O Master of infinite Radiance!

1318
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:35,528
Be gracious and shed a few beams
into my longing heart.

1319
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:42,469
The world is a whirlpool,

1320
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:45,772
Full of scorpions and snakes,

1321
01:21:45,772 --> 01:21:48,819
Which bite with lust, anger and hatred.

1322
01:21:49,242 --> 01:21:53,346
And people are drowning helplessly therein.

1323
01:21:55,148 --> 01:21:57,017
The world is a whirlpool,

1324
01:21:57,017 --> 01:22:00,453
Full of scorpions and snakes,

1325
01:22:00,453 --> 01:22:03,490
Which bite with lust, anger and hatred.

1326
01:22:03,823 --> 01:22:08,261
And people are drowning helplessly therein.

1327
01:22:09,696 --> 01:22:13,199
O Master, King of all the Kings,

1328
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,503
Please take them back
to the mansion of Peace,

1329
01:22:16,503 --> 01:22:20,206
And restore to them the Eternal Spring.

1330
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:25,078
When You cast Your lyrical glance
at somebody,

1331
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:29,683
That person would believe
she is Your only beloved.

1332
01:22:31,651 --> 01:22:35,422
When You cast Your lyrical glance
at somebody,

1333
01:22:35,422 --> 01:22:40,226
That person would believe
she is Your only beloved.

1334
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:45,932
O Loveliest of all the lovely!

1335
01:22:45,932 --> 01:22:49,769
Cast a hundred thousand glances on me.

1336
01:22:51,738 --> 01:22:56,876
I’d sell all the suns, the moons
and the stars in the universe,

1337
01:22:56,876 --> 01:23:02,215
I’d sell all the suns, the moons
and the stars in the universe,

1338
01:23:02,215 --> 01:23:05,552
Just to buy one of Your beautiful glances.

1339
01:23:05,552 --> 01:23:08,888
O Master of infinite Radiance!

1340
01:23:08,888 --> 01:23:13,727
Be gracious and shed a few beams
into my longing heart.

1341
01:23:53,633 --> 01:23:55,168
Hey, baby!

1342
01:23:56,202 --> 01:23:57,537
Wait. You’re mine!

1343
01:23:57,537 --> 01:23:58,872
Or – you’re with this loser?!

1344
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:00,373
He has my book!

1345
01:24:00,373 --> 01:24:02,642
Hey, oh, that’s all my money!

1346
01:24:02,642 --> 01:24:03,910
I demand you get my diary!

1347
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:04,826
No, that’s all I’ve got!
(Too bad.)

1348
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:06,646
That’s all I’ve got!

1349
01:24:06,646 --> 01:24:08,648
Get my book!

1350
01:24:08,648 --> 01:24:10,684
Emergency stop. All stop!

1351
01:24:13,753 --> 01:24:15,055
Get your hands off my bag!

1352
01:24:15,055 --> 01:24:16,489
What are you…?! Oh!

1353
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:03,934


1354
01:25:04,537 --> 01:25:08,408
